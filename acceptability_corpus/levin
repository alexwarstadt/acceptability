Preface
The set of resource materials on the English verb lexicon which make
up this book grew out of work begun as part of the cross-linguistic study
of lexical organization and lexical representation undertaken by the Lexicon
Project of the MIT Center for Cognitive Science, which I was affiliated
with during the years 1983-1987. I thank Ken Hale and Jay Keyser, the codirectors
of the project, for giving me the opportunity to participate in the
stimulating research atmosphere of the project. This book would never have
happened without the Lexicon Project: it started life as a handout on lexical
organization prepared for the project's seminar series. The book contains
expanded and revised versions of earlier lists of verb classes and diathesis
alternations (dated 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1989), which have been previously
circulated.
More people than I can hope to acknowledge have contributed to this work.
The late Bill Martin first encouraged me to think deeply about these issues. Boris
Katz, Judy Kegl, Betsy Ritter, Jane Simpson, and especially Sue Atkins deserve
my special thanks for their continuing encouragement to get the material in this
book into a form that could be published. I would like to thank Sue Atkins,
Ken Hale, Mary Laughren, Maika Rappaport Hovav, and Betsy Ritter for many
valuable discussions. Roz Fergusson and Jim McCawley offered extensive
and detailed comments on an earlier draft. Michael Brent, Annette Herskovitz,
Geoff Huck, Talke Macfarland, and Tova Rapoport also commented on portions
of the draft. I am grateful to Olivia Chang, Li Ya Fei, Tina Nielsen, Tova
Rapoport, and Betsy Ritter for help in compiling this book and its precursors;
to Olivia Chang, Jazmine Loiselle, Alice Rusnock, and Kirsten Winge for help
with the bibliography; to David Weir for help with 􀠚TffC; to Ken Church
for generating the verb index; and to Christine Bartels for her excellent job
copyediting the manuscript. I am also indebted to the many linguists and
lexicographers whose work I have drawn on in preparing this book.
The compilation of this book was aided by a series of discussions among
xviii Preface
members of the Lexicon Project during 1 98 5-6 and by two meetings of the
Lexicon Seminar in the fall of 1985 that were devoted to discussions of verb
properties. The contents have also benefited from meetings of the Working
Group on the Polytheoretical Lexicon in 1 987, as well as from the Workshops
on the Lexicon held at both the 1 986 Linguistic Institute at CUNY and the 1 987
Linguistic Institute at Stanford University.
The Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary in electronic form has been an
invaluable tool for filling out specific sets of verbs. A variety of dictionaries
in printed form have also aided this work. They include: The Collins-Robert
English-French Dictionary, The Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary,
The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, and The Longman
Lexicon of Contemporary English.
During the years 1 983-1987, this work was supported by a grant from the
System Development Foundation to the Lexicon Project of the MIT Center for
Cognitive Science. Since 1989, this work has been supported in part by NSF
Grant BNS-8919884.
I hope that this book serves to stimulate further research into the lexical
organization and lexical representation of English verbs.
Introduction:
The Theoretical Perspective
The resource materials on the English verb lexicon presented in this book
represent some initial results of an ongoing investigation of the syntactic and
semantic properties of English verbs. This introduction gives an overview of the
conception of lexical knowledge that forms the foundation for this investigation
and shows how a research program devoted to compiling the kinds of materials
included here can assist in increasing such knowledge.
This work is guided by the assumption that the behavior of a verb, particularly
with respect to the expression and interpretation of its arguments, is to a large
extent det􀠛rmined by its meaning. Thus verb behavior can be used effectively
to probe for linguistically relevant pertinent aspects of verb meaning. This book
offers an attempt at delimiting and systematizing the facets of verb behavior.
Its contents should help pave the way toward the development of a theory of
lexical knowledge. Ideally, such a theory must provide linguistically motivated
lexical entries for verbs which incorporate a representation of verb meaning anq
which allow the meanings of verbs to be properly associated with the syntactic
expressions of their arguments.
The Nature of Lexical Knowledge
One of the most widely known views of the lexicon is that articulated by B loomfield
( 1 933), who wrote, "The lexicon is really an appendix of the grammar, a
list of basic irregularities" (p. 274 ). Bloomfield's view conforms to a frequently
articulated desideratum for an ideal lexicon-a lexicon that contains the minimum
information necessary and that, therefore, as B loomfield proposes, has to
provide a record of precisely the idiosyncratic information associated with each
lexical item. However, this view of the lexicon offers an incomplete picture of
lexical knowledge as a whole. The knowledge that a speaker demonstrates with
respect to lexical items suggests that there is more to lexical knowledge than
knowledge of idiosyncratic word-specific properties.
2 Introduction
This characteristic of lexical knowledge is easily illustrated with respect to
verbs. Verbs, as argument-taking elements, show especially complex sets of
properties. As shown in B . Levin {l985b, in prep.) and other works, native
speakers can make extremely subtle judgments concerning the occurrence of
verbs with a range of possible combinations of arguments and adjuncts in
various syntactic expressions. For instance, speakers of English know which
diathesis alternations-alternations in the expressions of arguments, sometimes
accompanied by changes of meaning-verbs may participate in. They
know that verbs such as spray and load may express their arguments in two
different ways, displaying the so-called locative alternation.
( l ) a. Sharon sprayed water on the plants.
b. Sharon sprayed the plants with water.
(2) a. The farmer loaded apples into the cart.
b. The farmer loaded the cart with apples.
But the same speakers know that some verbs which are apparently closely
related to spray and load do not allow both options: fill and cover show one
possibility, while dump and pour show the other.
(3) a. * Monica covered a blanket over the baby.
b. Monica covered the baby with a blanket.
( 4) a. * Gina filled lemonade into the pitcher.
b. Gina filled the pitcher with lemonade.
(5) a. Carla poured lemonade into the pitcher.
b. *C arla poured the pitcher with lemonade.
(6) a. The farmer dumped apples into the cart.
b. *The farmer dumped the cart with apples.
Furthermore, speakers agree in their judgments concerning subtle differences
·in meaning associated with alternate expressions of a verb's arguments.
For instance, they know that sentence (2b) suggests that the cart is full,
but that sentence (2a) need not suggest this. Thus (2a), but not ( 2b), could
be used to describe a cart that is half-full of apples. (This is the muchdiscussed
"holistic/partitive" effect; see references cited in Part I under Locative
Alternation.)
A speaker of English also knows whether a verb. may participate in one
of various transitivity alternations found in English--diathesis alternations
that involve a change in a verb's transitivity. So for example, although the
verb break shows transitive and intransitive uses, where the transitive use
of the verb means roughly "cause to break-intransitive," this possibilityknown
as the causative!inchoative alternation-is not available for the verb
Introduction 3
appear. That is, the verb appear cannot be used transitively to mean "cause to
appear-intransitive."
(7) a. The window broke. (inchoative variant)
b. The little boy .broke the window. (causative variant)
(8) a. A rabbit appeared out of the magician's hat.
b. * The magician appeared a rabbit out of his hat.
The ability to make such judgments extends to novel combinations of arguments
and adjuncts. For instance, speakers of English know that benefactive
phrases, though typically expressed as for prepositional phrases, can sometimes
be expressed as the first object in the double object construction.
(9) a. Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby.
b. Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood.
Yet a speaker also knows when this option is not available. Though ( l Oa) is
a near-paraphrase of (9a), speakers of English know that there is no sentence
(lOb) comparable to (9b) where the benefactive is expressed as an object.
( 1 0) a. Martha carved some wood into a toy for the baby.
b. * Martha carved the baby some wood into a toy.
English has productive morphological processes for deriving new verbs that
are zero-related to nouns, 1 and speakers of English have no difficulty in using
or understanding these verbs. The advent of electronic communication has been
accompanied not only by the widespread use of the noun modem, but also by
its use as a verb meaning 'communicate via modem' .
( 1 1 ) "I'll modem him tomorrow," said one of them, urged b y Mr. Krens to
get in touch with an out-of-town colleague. (Arts and Leisure Section,
New York Times, May 29, 1988, p. I)
Modem, then, is taking its place among a set of verbs that take their names
from instruments of communication (cable, wire, radio, etc.). Once again,
speakers are aware of the limitations on the process of creating denominal
verbs. Even though new verbs of this type are being coined daily, certain
imaginable uses of nouns as verbs are hot possible. As Hale and Keyser ( 1 992)
I Here and throughout this work, I use the term zero-related rather than zero-derived when
referring to the relation between the uses of a particular word in two lexical categories, such as the
use of tile as a noun and as a verb. This choice reflects a desire to remain neutral about the direction
of the relation, since although in some instances the direction is clear, in others it is not. Also, in
using the term "zero-related" I do not intend to take any position with respect to the debate as to
whether the derivational process involves the addition of a category-changing zero-morpheme or
not.
Introduction
point out, a speaker of English would never use the noun church as a verb
meaning "give to a church," as in *They churched the money.
Speakers of English also know that certain English verbs manifest what B .
Levin and Rapoport ( 1 988) have called extended meanings (or senses) and what
Apresjan ( 1973) calls regular polysemy. This phenomenon is best introduced
with an example. Verbs like whistle and roar, which basically describe the
emission of a sound, can regularly take on certain additional senses (see Atkins
and B. Levin ( 1 99 1 ), B. Levin ( 1 99 1 )). For instance, they can be used as verbs
of directed motion, describing an object moving and simultaneously emitting
a sound, as in The bullet whistled through the window or The car roared up the
driveway. Yet speakers know that they cannot use the apparently comparable
*The dog barked down the street behind the jogger to say that a dog ran down
the street barking behind a jogger.
The examples described in this section are representative of a wide range of
phenomena that suggest that a speaker's knowledge of the properties of a verb
goes well beyond an awareness of the simple expression of its arguments-the
type oflexical knowledge traditionally represented in subcategorization frames.
Furthermore, the speaker's ability to make subtle judgments about possible and
actual verbs and their properties makes it unlikely that all that a speaker knows
about a verb is indicated in its lexical entry.
Verb Meaning: A Key to Verb Behavior
What underlies the ability to make such judgments? Hale and Keyser ( 1 987)
present a telling example that suggests the following answer: what enables a
speaker to determine the behavior of a verb is its meaning.
Hale and Keyser consider the archaic English verb gaily, a whaling term, used
as in The sailors gallied the whales. A speaker of English who is unfamiliar
with this verb might assume that gaily means "see" (The sailors saw the
whales), while a second speaker might take gaily to mean "frighten" (The
sailors frightened the whales). What is striking is that, on the basis of these
assumptions about the meaning of gaily, the two speakers are able to make
judgments about its syntactic behavior. To illustrate this point, Hale and Keyser
look at the middle transitivity alternation. The subject of the intransitive middle
use of a verb corresponds to the object of the transitive use; compare the
transitive use of slice in The baker sliced the bread with the middle use of
the same verb, Stale bread slices easily.2 The speaker who believes that gaily
2 The middle alternation should not be confused with the causative/inchoative alternation illustrated
in (7) with the verb break. Although both are transitivity alternations where the subject
of the intransitive use of the verb bears the same semantic relation to the verb as the object of the
transitive use, there are qifferences between the two constructions. First, the middle construction
differs from the inchoative construction, the intransitive variant of the causative/inchoative alterIntroduction

means "see" would not allow the middle construction Whales gally easily (cf.
* Whales see easily), although the speaker who interprets gaily as "frighten"
will find this construction perfectly acceptable (cf. Whalesfrighten easily).
Thus the two speakers' different treatment of gally may be explained by their
different assumptions concerning its meaning. Hale and Keyser propose that
the middle construction is available only to a certain semantically defined class
of verbs: verbs whose meaning involves a notion of causing a change of state.
They point out that change of state verbs such as frighten, cut, split, open, and
crush have middles, but that other types of verbs such as see, consider, and
believe do not. Only the speaker who attributes the change of state meaning
"frighten" to gally will allow the verb to be used in the middle construction.
The speaker who----contrary to fact as it turns out-believes that gally means
"see" correctly does not allow this option.
The gally example shows vividly that for speakers of English, knowing the
meaning of a verb can be a key to knowing its behavior. Presumably, predictions
about verb behavior are feasible because particular syntactic properties are
associated with verbs of a certain semantic type. The gally example and others
like it suggest that general principles of grammar are at work, allowing the
syntactic behavior of a verb to be predicted from its meaning. Their existence
should explain a speaker's ability to make the judgments discussed in the
previous section.3
A More Complex Example
Further examination of the nature of lexical knowledge confirms that various
aspects of the syntactic behavior of verbs are tied to their meaning. Moreover,
verbs that fall into classes according to shared behavior would be expected
to show shared meaning components. This point about the nature of lexical
knowledge can be demonstrated with a more extensive example: an investigation
of the verbs break, cut, hit, and touch, which draws on several studies of
these verbs, including Fillmore ( 1 967), Guerssel, Hale, Laughren, B . Levin,
and White Eagle ( 1 985), Hale and Keyser ( 1986, 1 987), and Laughren ( 1 988).
nation, in not denoting an event; that is, it need not have a specific time reference. Second, the
middle construction always implies an agent (Crystal vases shatter easily), while the inchoative
construction need not (The crystal vase shattered). See the discussion of these two alternations in
Part I and the references cited there.
3 Providing an explanation for each of these judgments goes beyond the scope of this introduction.
See Rappaport and B. Levin (1988) and Pinker (1989) for a discussion of the spray/load
facts. See Hale and Keyser (1991) for a discussion of the church example and E. V. Clark and H. H.
Clark (1979) for more general discussion of productive strategies for coining verbs from nouns.
The extended meaning example is discussed in B. Levin ( 1991) and B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav
(1991). The causative/inchoative alternation is discussed at greater length in the following section.
6 Introduction
The verbs break, cut, hit, and touch are transitive, taking two arguments
expressed as subject and object, but we will see that they have little else in
common.
( 1 2) a. Margaret cut the bread.
b. Janet broke the vase.
c. Terry touched the cat.
d. Carla hit the door.
In particular, these verbs differ with respect to their participation in diathesis
alternations. First, the middle alternation differentiates among these four verbs.
Only cut and break, but not hit and touch, are found in the middle construction.4
( 1 3) a. The bread cuts easily.
b. Crystal vases break easily.
c. * Cats touch easily.
d. * Door frames hit easily.
On the other hand, cut and hit appear in the conative construction, as shown
in ( 14), but break and touch do not.
( 1 4) a. Margaret cut at the bread.
b. * Janet broke at the vase.
c. * Terry touched at the cat.
d. Carla hit at the door.
The conative alternation is also a transitivity alternation, but unlike the middle
and causative/inchoative alternations, the subject of the transitive variant ( 12)
and intransitive variant ( 1 4) bears the same semantic relation to the verb.
The variants differ in the expression of the other argument: in the conative
construction, the argument corresponding to the object of the transitive variant
is expressed in a prepositional phrase headed by at. The conative construction
is set apart by its meaning: there is no entailment that the action denoted by the
verb was completed. Thus ( 1 4a) means something like "Margaret tried to cut
the bread."
Yet another diathesis alternation-the body-part possessor ascension alternation-
distinguishes cut, hit, and touch from break. Only break does not
display this alternation.
4 The uses of hit in this section involve the simple "contact through the motion of an instrument"
sense of this verb. The verb hit is not found in the middle construction on this sense, which does
not necessarily involve any subsequent motion of the entity that is hit. However, the verb hit has a
second sense that might be described as "contact using an instrument and set in motion," as in The
batter hit the ball over the fence. This second sense of hit allows the middle for some speakers.
To ensure that the examples in this section unambiguously involve the simple sense of hit, the
examples have an immovable entity as the object of the verb.

· This alternation is 􀠜haracterized by a change in the expression of a possessed
body part: either the possessed body part may be expressed as the direct object
of the verb, as in the (a) sentences, or the possessor may be expressed as the
object of the verb, with the possessed body part expressed in a prepositional
phrase, as in the (b) sentences.
Each verb shows a distinct pattern of behavior with respect to these three
alternations, as summarized in the table.
touch hit cut break
Conative: No Yes Yes No
Body-Part Possessor Ascension: Yes Yes Yes No
Middle: No No Yes Yes
The four patterns ofbehavior observed here cannot simply be dismissed because
they are linked to four different verbs. Corresponding to each one of these four
verbs are other verbs that show the same pattern of behavior.
( 1 9) a. Break Verbs: break, crack, rip, shatter, snap, . . .
b. Cut Verbs: cut, hack, saw, scratch, slash, . . .
c. Touch Verbs: pat, stroke, tickle, touch, .. .
d. Hit Verbs: bash, hit, kick, pound, tap, whack, . . .
Not only can four verb classes be recognized that are defined by the shared
behavior of their members with respect to the above diathesis alternations,
but several studies (Fillmore ( 1967), Guerssel et al. ( 1 985), Hale and Keyser
( 1986, 1 987)) have examined each set of verbs in ( 1 9) closely and found that
their members share certain aspects of meaning. Thus their members have
common syntactic as well as semantic properties. These studies propose that
the differences in verb behavior can be explained if the diathesis alternations
are sensitive to particular components of verb meaning.
As a first step in identifying the relevant meaning components, let ·us look
more closely at the body-part possessor ascension alternation. What distinguishes
cut, hit, and touch, which enter into this alternation, from break, which
8 Introduction
does not, is that the actions the first three verbs denote necessarily involve contact.
Although the real-world event denoted by the verb break often involves
contact, i t need not. Evidence drawn from an examination of a variety of diathesis
alternations indicates that, linguistically speaking, break is a pure change
of state verb and a notion of contact is not inherent to its meaning (see below).
It appears that a verb shows the body-part possessor ascension alternation only
if its meaning involves the notion of contact.
But even if the meaning component 'contact' is common to cut, hit, and touch,
there must be further meaning components that distinguish between them. After
all, touch, unlike the other two, does not show the conative alternation. Guerssel
et al. ( 1 985) suggest that verbs which enter into the conative alternation have
meanings that involve both motion and contact components. Only the meanings
of hit and cut involve both. The motion component is missing from the meaning
of touch, which is a pure verb of contact, while the meaning of break lacks both
these components. If both contact and motion are necessary for the conative
alternation, then pure verbs of motion would also be predicted not to show this
alternation, and in fact, they do not. 5
(20) a. Jean moved the table.
b. * Jean moved at the table.
As we have also seen, cut and break both show the middle alternation, while
hit and touch do not. As discussed above, this alternation is manifested by verbs
of causing a change of state. The behavior of the verbs hit and touch suggests
that they are not change of state verbs. And indeed, hitting and touching need
not entail a change of state, unlike cutting and breaking. Although they behave
differently in some respects from one another, cut and break nevertheless show
similarities that go beyond the middle construction. For instance, both have
associated zero-related nominals with a similar interpretation: they refer to the
result of the action. In contrast, the nominals zero-related to hit and touch do
not allow this interpretation, but refer instead to the action itself.
5 The interpretation that would be expected to be associated with the conative use of move in
(20b), if this construction were possible, would be roughly "Jean attempted to move the table."
However, this particular conjunction of meaning and syntactic frame is not observed. The verb move
can be found with an at phrase, as in The two opponents moved at each other, but the interpretation
associated with this use of move is not that expected in the conative construction. Rather, the use
of at here parallels that found in run at or charge at. Furthermore, this use of at is not paired with
a transitive use of the verb that is derived by "dropping" the preposition at; Tire opponents moved
each other is not at all related to The opponents moved at each other. The existence of this use
of at, as well as inany other uses of at with verbs that do not show the conative alternation, raises
another question: Are there some meaning components that are common to all these uses of the
preposition? If there are, they may not be precisely the ones that determine participation in the
conative alternation. The investigation of a unified characterization of at falls outside the scope of
this book.
Introduction 9
(21 ) a. a break
b. a cut
c. a hit
d. a touch
This additional difference supports the proposal that cut and break are both
verbs of causing a change of state; presumably, the actions they denote have a
result that can be referred to by a nominal.
Finally, a few words concerning the difference between cut and break. Although
the meaning of both verbs involves a change of state, cut's meaning
also involves notions of contact and motion. The verb cut describes bringing
about a change of state by means of contact through motion; cutting involves
bringing a sharp object into contact with a surface and causing a "separation in
its material integrity" in the words of Hale and Keyser ( 1986). The verb break is
a pure change of state verb: in both its transitive and intransitive uses it simply
expresses a change of state (plus a notion of cause when transitive), without
specifying how this change of state comes about. For example, throwing a rock
at a window, bending a twig sharply, and dropping a · cup are only a few of
the many imaginable ways of breaking things. Not only does break differ from
cut in not showing the conative or body-part possessor ascension alternations,
but break, unlike cut, participates in th􀠝 causative/inchoative alternation, as
illustrated above in (7), which is repeated here as (22).
(22) a. The window broke.
b. The little boy broke the window.
(23) a. Margaret cut the string.
b. * The string cut. (on the interpretation "became cut")
This fact has been attributed to this alternation's sensitivity to pure change
of state verbs. And as expected, since they are not change of state verbs, the
verbs hit or touch are not found in the causative/inchoative alternation.6
(24) a. Terry touched the cat.
b. * The cat touched.
(25) a. Carla hit the door.
b. * The door hit. .
Studies such as Guerssel et al. ( 1985) offer an explanation for the contrasting
behavior of break and cut. A pure change of state verb like break is basically a
single-argument verb, denoting an entity undergoing a change of state, as in the
inchoative variant. The two-argument form of the verb found in the causative
6 The absence of a causative form for appear illustrated in (8) would be attributed to its not
being a verb of change of state; it belongs to the class of verbs of appearance.
1 0 Imroductiorr
variant is derived by the addition of a notion of cause. Because the meaning of a
verb like cut inherently involves an instrument, this verb requires the existence
of an agent that uses this instrument to bring about a change of state in the
patient; hence, cut is basically a two-argument verb and would never be found
in the inchoative construction. Both cut and break are found in the middle
construction because this construction is open to verbs of causing a change
of state, whether or not their meaning also specifies how this change of state
comes about.
The four verbs examined in this section then differ as follows: touch is a pure
verb of contact, hit is a verb of contact by motion, cut is a verb of causing a
change of state by moving something into contact with the entity that changes
state, and break is a pure verb of change of state. These characterizations are not
intended to exhaust the meaning of these verbs; rather, they simply capture those
aspect􀇊 of meaning that serve minimally to distinguish the verbs participating in
the alternations discussed here. The notions of motion, contact, change of state,
and causation that figure in these characterizations must be taken into account
in selecting a lexical representation of verb meaning. These same notions are
correlated with participation in diathesis alternations, including those discussed
here. The body-part possessor ascension alternation is sensitive to the notion of
contact, while the conative alternation is sensitive to both contact and motion.
The causative/inchoative alternation is found only with verbs of pure change of
state, while the middle alternation is found with verbs whose meaning involves
causing a change of state.
The existence of ties between verb behavior and verb meaning is not particular
to English. Alternations-including analogues of many of those found
in English-are manifested across languages by verbs of the same semantic
types. To take one example, the Australian language Warlpiri also shows the
conative alternation. As in English, this alternation is not found with breaktype
verbs and touch-type verbs, though it is found with hit-type and cut-type
verbs.7 Such examples reinforce the evidence from English that certain com-
·
ponents of verb meaning determine verb behavior. This is not to say that all
languages have the same inventory of verbs or diathesis alternations. 8 But to the
extent that languages are similar-and the similarities between them are often
great-the same meaning components, and hence the same classes of verbs,
figure in the statement of regularities concerning the expression of arguments.
Even when alternations are specific to only some languages, they are often

Introduction l l
sensitive to aspects of verb meaning that have been shown to be significant to
the characterization of verb behavior in other languages as well.
The discussion of break, cut, hit, and touch underscores the conclusions
drawn in the earlier sections. Studies of diathesis alternations show that verbs in
English and other languages fall into classes on the basis of shared components
of meaning. The class members have in common a range of properties, including
the possible expression and interpretation of their arguments, as well as the
existence of certain morphologically related forms. Furthermore, the existence
of regular relationships between verb meaning and verb behavior suggests
that not all aspects of a verb's behavior need to be listed in its lexical entry,
a conclusion also suggested by a speaker's ability to make judgments about
possible and actual verbs and their properties. The picture that emerges is that a
verb's behavior arises from the interaction of its meaning and general principles
of grammar. Thus the lexical knowledge of a speaker of a language ·must
.include knowledge of the meaning of individual verbs, the meaning components
that determine the syntactic behavior of verbs, and the general principles that
determine behavior from verb meaning.
The Larger Context
These observations about the nature of lexical knowledge fit well with proposals
that the ideal lexical entry for a word should minimize the information provided
for that word. This goal can be achieved by factoring predictable information
out of lexical entries, leaving only idiosyncratic information. If the syntactic
properties of a verb indeed follow in large part from its meaning, then i t should
be possible to identify general principles that derive the behavior of a verb from
its meaning. Given such principles, the meaning of a verb will clearly have a
place in its lexical entry, but it is possible that the entry will need to contain little
more. And since a word's meaning is necessarily idiosyncratic, the inclusion of
a word's meaning in its lexical entry conforms to Bloomfield's characterization
of the lexicon as a locus of idiosyncrasy. In fact, Bloomfield ( 1 933) follows his
famous statement to this effect by writing that this view of the lexicon " . . . is all
the more evident if meanings are taken into consideration, since the meaning
of each morpheme belongs to it by an arbitrary tradition" (p. 274). Certainly
this statement is just as true of words-at least monomorphemic words and
multi-morpheme words whose meanings are not compositional. (It is not clear
that this statement should apply to multi-morpheme words whose meanings
are compositionally determined. The properties of such words are determined
from their component parts, as discussed in recent work on argument structure
and morphology; see, for example, Lieber ( 1983), Rappaport Hovav and B.
Levin ( 1 992), Sproat ( 1 985), Williams ( 198 1 ).)
l 2 Introduction
Taking this approach seriously requires a re-evaluation of previous assumptions
concerning the contents of lexical entries, since it suggests that they may
contain less information than has sometimes been proposed. Specifically, if
there are indeed correlations between verb meaning and verb behavior, some
properties that might have been included in lexical entri.es because they were
thought to be idiosyncratic could tum out on further examination to be predictable
from verb meaning and could be eliminated from a verb's lexical
entry.
Subcategorization frames are a case in point. Recently, there has been much
investigation of the proposal that the subcategorization requirements of a lexical
item might be predictable from its meaning, a position that is consistent
with the view of lexical knowledge proposed here, though the motivation has
come from efforts to constrain the power of syntactic rules. Those facets of
syntactic constructions that cannot be made to follow from general principles of
grammar are considered to be projections of the lexical properties of the words
in these constructions. Concomitantly, the lexicon has assumed an increasingly
central place in several syntactic frameworks (e.g., Government-Binding, Lexical
Functional Grammar, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar), and much
effort has been devoted to investigating the nature of lexical representation.
This move has led to an increased ipterest in argument structure-the representation
and characterization of argument-taking properties of verbs and other
predicators. As discussed here, studies of these properties suggest that argument
structures might in tum be derivable to a large extent from the meaning
of words. Chomsky (1986), for example, speculates that only the meaning of
a verb needs to be learned, and "semantic bootstrapping" models of child language
acquisition (Pinker (1989)) are built on the assumption that a word's
syntactic properties are predictable from its meaning. Within this context then,
the ability to build representations of linguistically relevant aspects of word
meaning and to formulate the principles that determine syntactic properties
from word meaning becomes essential.
Challenges
Although no one is likely to deny that words with similar meaning show at least
some tendency toward displaying the same syntactic behavior, the hypothesis
that the syntactic behavior of a word is fully semantically determined is not
uncontroversial. Many researchers have argued that this hypothesis must be
rejected, citing numerous purported counterexamples to it. Nevertheless, the
meaning of a verb does have considerable predictive ability, as the examples
above and examples cited in other work illustrate, suggesting that the ties between
a verb's meaning and its syntactic behavior cannot simply be ignored.
And there are studies that show that this hypothesis receives substantial support,
Introduction 1 3
particularly in restricted domains (Laughren ( 1 988), B . Levin and Rappaport
Hovav ( 199 1 ), Zwicky ( 1 97 l a), among others). This work pursues the hypothesis
of semantic determination seriously to see just how .far it can be taken,
even if it does ultimately tum out to meet with limited success (see Jackendoff
( 1 990b) for some discussion).
The key to maintaining this hypothesis is the identification of the appropriate
representation of verb meaning. Determining the appropriate meaning components
is not easy, since a priori it is possible to classify verbs in many ways
according to their meaning. So it would not be surprising if some proposed
semantic/syntactic correlations did not make reference to the proper choice of
meaning components. Such correlations will be found to have limited applicability,
suggesting that the relation between verb meaning and verb behavior
is more idiosyncratic than it actually is and that the search for generalizations
is doomed to fail. However, these conclusions may not be warranted.
Apparent deviations from semantic/syntactic correlations might reflect the
use of the wrong meaning components in the statement of the correlations,
rather than the absence of such correlations. It is possible that many examples
intended to demonstrate the limitations of the hypothesis that syntactic properties
are semantically determined might, if reanalyzed, tum out to support it.
An illustration, discussed in B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav (199 1 , 1 992) and
repeated here, underscores the importance of carefully evaluating purported
counterexamples to the hypothesis.
This illustration involves the Unaccusative Hypothesis, a hypothesis concerning
the syntactic configurations associated _with intransitive verbs first proposed
by Perlmutter ( 1 978) and further elaborated by Burzio ( 1986). The proposal is
that the single argument of some intransitive verbs, the unaccusative verbs, is
an underlying object, while the single argument of the others, the unergative
verbs, is an underlying subject. The Unaccusative Hypothesis has provided
a rich context for debating whether syntactic behavior is semantically determined.
Some researchers, including Perlmutter himself, have argued that the
membership of an intransitive verb in the unaccusative or unergative class can
be determined from its meaning. However, other researchers, including Rosen
( 1984), have concluded that meaning alone is not predictive of class membership.
To support this view, Rosen points out that bodily process verbs in Italian
do not show uniform behavior: russare 'snore' patterns like an unergative verb,
while arrossire 'blush' patterns like an unaccusative verb.
But in fact, this particular example only emphasizes the importance of identifying
the appropriate meaning components and does not necessarily argue
against the semantic determination of syntactic properties. The verbs russare
'snore' and arrossire 'blush' would be expected to show similar behavior only
if the semantic notion "bodily process" plays a part in determining a verb's
status with respect to the Unaccusative Hypothesis. If it does not, then these
1 4 Introduction
verbs need not necessarily pattern in the same way. The fact that they do not
suggests that the semantic notion "bodily process" is probably not relevant to
verb classification. There are other possible characterizations of bodily process
verbs. The concept denoted by English snore can be classified as an activity
in the sense of Vendler ( 1 957), while that denoted by English blush is open
either to an activity or to a change of state interpretation. Interestingly, Italian
arrossire 'blush' literally means "become red," suggesting that arrossire is a
change of state verb. There is evidence, in fact, that the semantic notions of activity
and change of state are facets of meaning that figure iil the determination
of a verb's status with respect to the Unaccusative Hypothesis (B . Levin and
Rappaport Hovav ( 1 992), McClure ( 1990), Tenny ( 1987), Van Valin (1990),
Zaenen (in press)).
If the hypothesis that syntactic properties are semantically determined is
taken seriously, then the task is to determine, first, to what extent the meaning of
a verb determines its syntactic behavior, and second, to the extent that syntactic
behavior is predictable, what components of verb meaning figure in the relevant
generalizations. The identification of the relevant components of meaning is
essential if this approach is to be successful. And once these questions are
answered, others remain. What kind of lexical representation of verb meaning
is necessary? How are the mapping rules formulated that determine the syntactic
properties? And more important, why are certain phenomena sensitive to certain
meaning components? The attested patterns of behavior exhibited by verbs
in English and other languages must be accounted for in a principled and
systematic way. The present study is intended to lay the groundwork that will
facilitate the future investigation of these questions, even though it does not
offer .explicit answers.
The Underlying Research Methodology
The assumption that the syntactic behavior of verbs is semantically determined
gives rise to a powerful technique for investigating verb meaning that can be
exploited in the development of a theory of lexical knowledge. If the distinctive
behavior of verb classes with respect to diathesis alternations arises from their
meaning, any class of verbs whose members pattern together with respect to
diathesis alternations should be a semantically coherent class: its members
should share at least some aspect of meaning. Once such a class is identified,
· its members can be examined to isolate the meaning components they have in
common. Thus diathesis alternations can be used to provide a probe into the
elements entering into the lexical representation of word meaning.9
9 A similar approach is proposed and illustrated by Deane and Wheeler ( 1984), who call it
"correlation analysis." See also Green ( 1974, 66-69) and Wierzbicka (1987, 24-26).
Introduction 1 5
The availability of this technique for investigating word meaning i s important
since it can be quite difficult to pin down the meanings of words using
introspection alone. For instance, dictionaries provide. rather different definitions
of the sense of the verb whistle found in the context The bullet whistled
through the air. They seem unsure whether to treat this sense as involving a
verb of sound or a verb of motion. Thus Webster 's Ninth (Mish ( 1 986)) sees this
sense as involving sound emission, giving the definition "to make a shrill clear
sound, esp. by rapid movement;" in contrast, the Collins English Dictionary
(Hanks ( 1986)) gives the definition "to move with a whistling sound caused by
rapid passage through the air." By itself, intuition provides little guidance as to
which one of these definitions is correct.
Distinctions induced by diathesis alternations help to provide insights into
verb meaning, and more generally into the organization of the English verb
lexicon, that might not otherwise be apparent, bringing out unexpected similarities
and differences between verbs. A striking example is provided by verbs
of motion. Verbs of motion are frequently cited as a large and important class
within the English verb inventory. Yet a study of the syntactic behavior of
these verbs (B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 992)) shows that this class is
not homogeneous. It includes at least a subclass of verbs of inherently directed
motion (e.g., arrive, come, go) and a subclass of verbs of manner of motion
(e.g., jump, run, trot, skip). In the absence of a directional prepositional phrase,
verbs of directed motion describe the direction of motion but not the manner of
motion, while verbs of manner of motion describe the manner of motion but not
the direction. In fact, some verbs of manner of motion do not necessarily entail
any displacement, as in run in place. However, the verbs run and whistle--one
a verb of motion and the other a verb of sound emission-are in some respects
more similar to each other than the verbs run and come-although both are
verbs of motion. The verbs run and whistle manifest a similar extended meaning:
both can be used as verbs of directed motion in the presence of a directional
prepositional phrase (The bullet whistled through the window, The man ran into
the room), though neither is basically a verb of this type. Returning to the question
of the best definition for one of the senses of whistle, it is likely that the
Collins English Dictionary is on the right track in treating the relevant sense as
a motion sense, since the verb shows the complement-taking properties of verbs
of motion in this sense, which is only available in the presence of a directional
phrase.
As these examples show, by providing independent criteria for isolating narrow
classes of verbs known to share certain aspects of meaning, the study of
diathesis alternations can lead to the identification of the linguistically relevant
meaning components which determine a verb's behavior. In order to identify
the full set of meaning components that figure in the lexical representation of
verb meaning, the investigation of semantically relevant syntactic properties
1 6 Introduction
and the ensuing clustering of verbs into classes need to be carried out over a
larger and larger number of verbs occurring in a wide range of constructions. A
growing number of studies of the syntactic behavior of English verbs are being
conducted with the goal of identifying such meaning components; see, for example,
Guerssel ( 1 986), Guerssel et at. ( 1 985), Hale and Keyser ( 1 986, 1 987),
B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 99 1 , 1 992), Rappaport and B. Levin ( 1 988).
Furthermore, as discussed above, work on other languages can provide additional
support both for this technique of studying lexical representation and for
the results that it achieves. Interestingly, as noted in B . Levin and Pinker ( 1 99 1 ),
certain meaning components identified via the study of semantic/syntactic correlations
show considerable overlap with the set of elements posited as being
central to the meanings of English verbs in studies that approach the problem
of verb meaning from the perspectives of language acquisition and cognition
(Jackendoff ( 1 983, 1 990b), G.A. Miller and Johnson-Laird ( 1 976), Pinker
( 1989)).
The nature of these meaning components, in turn, would be expected to
influence the selection of a lexical representation of verb meaning that allows
for the observed behavior. In fact, some of the studies listed above move
beyond an examination of verb behavior to a consideration of its implications
for the choice of a lexical representation of verb meaning and for the principles
mapping from such a representation to the syntax. One of the conclusions that
emerges from such studies is that the complex pattern of behavior manifested
by verbs with respect to diathesis alternations cannot be explained with a
lexical semantic representation that takes the form of a list of semantic roles
(see Grimshaw ( 1 990), Rappaport and B . Levin ( 1 988), among others). These
studies, as well as other recent work, propose lexical semantic representations
that take the form of predicate decompositions, though there are significant
differences in detail.
Although the hypothesis that meaning determines syntax has been used
before in lexical semantic studies, its success within limited, well-defined
domains shown in current work such as the studies cited above depends in part
on the investigation of intricate and extensive patterns of syntactic behavior.
Research of this kind looks not only at the subcategorizaiion frame of a verb,
but also examines a wider constellation of properties, particularly a verb's
participation in diathesis alternations, and also to a more limited extent its
morphological properties and extended meanings. Such wide-ranging studies
are necessary because it is unlikely that a single· property can be isolated
that will prove sufficient to characterize a particular class of verbs (see also
Mufwene ( 1 978) ). Each class of verbs displays a set of properties which together
reflect the meaning components of its members. Since many of these meaning
components are common to more than one class of verbs, properties that are
Introduction 1 7
attributable to a single meaning component will be manifested by verbs from
various classes. Although any single property of a class of verbs will in itself
not be very informative, the conjunction of properties shown by a class of
verbs may well be more revealing, since it will reflect the entire set of meaning
components shared by the class members. For this reason, continued progress
in the development of a theory of lexical knowledge of verbs will depend on
an extensive exploration of verb behavior.
The Scope of this Book
This book offers the results of a preliminary large-scale investigation of the
behavior of English .verbs. It is divided into two major parts that reflect the
nature of lexical knowledge as it has been described in this introduction. Part I
of the book sets out a range of diathesis alternations that are relevant to a
speaker's lexical knowledge of English. Part II presents a large number of
semantically coherent classes of verbs whose members pattern in the same way
with respect to diathesis alternations and other properties. The classes that are
identified in Part II of the book have emerged from the study of the diathesis
alternations set out in Part I.
This book tries to strike a balance between breadth and depth of coverage.
Many of the diathesis alternations and verb classes included are familiar and
well studied. Others have received relatively little attention, and I hope that
their inclusion may stimulate further study. This introduction is intended to
justify the general approach toward the exploration of the English verb inventory,
though it cannot hope to argue for the inclusion of any given diathesis
alternation or verb class. The classificatory distinctions in this book have been
drawn using criteria of the type discussed throughout this introduction. They
involve the expression of arguments of verbs, including alternate expressions
of arguments and special interpretations associated with particular expressions
of arguments of the type that are characteristic of diathesis alternations. Certain
morphological properties of verbs, such as the existence of various types of
related nominals and adjectives, have been used as well, since they are also tied
to the argument-taking properties of verbs.
The verb classes that are identified in this book should be "handled with
care," since there is a sense in which the notion of "verb class" i s an artificial
construct. Verb classes arise because a set of verbs with one or more shared
meaning components show similar behavior. · Some meaning components cut
across the classes identified here, as attested by the existence of properties
common to several verb classes. For instance, the meaning components contact
and motion are common to the hit verbs and the cut verbs, as manifested by
their participation in the conative alternation. However, the meaning component
1 8 Introduction
contact alone would also have picked out the touch verbs, as well as the hit
and cut verbs. Thus, since most verbs are characterized by several meaning
components, there is potential for cross-classification, which in tum means that
other, equally valid classification schemes might have been identified instead
of the scheme presented in Part II of the book.
The important theoretical construct is the notion of meaning component, not
the notion of verb class. This point is also argued for by Mufwene ( 1978) in
a follow-up to Zwicky's ( 1 97 l a) exploration of the properties of manner of
speaking verbs. Mufwene argues that the identification of this class of verbs
is of limited value since each of the twenty properties which Zwicky ascribes
to manner of speaking verbs is shared by other types of verbs as well. A more
explanatory account would result, Mufwene argues, if rather than tying the
properties to a list of verb classes, they were associated with particular meaning
components that are common to all verbs showing the property, whether or not
they are manner of speaking verbs. Thus Mufwene favors "identifying a specific
feature . . . as a component of a lexical entry . . . which triggers a given behavior
or is held responsible for a given property" (p. 278).
· Mufwene is right, but the identification of the meaning components poses
a real challenge. Their identification is an eventual aim of the line of research
described here. As discussed in the previous section, an examination of classes
of verbs defined by shared behavior can play an important part in zeroing in on
these meaning components. In this book, I have chosen a level of classification
characterized by interesting clustering of verbs that should further the isolation
of meaning components. The classification system does not take into account
every property of every verb, since such a system would be liable to consist of
classes having only one member, a state of affairs that would not provide much
insight into the overall structure of the English verb lexicon.
Having set out what the book attempts to do, I would now like to tum briefly
to what it does not attempt to do. This book presents a snapshot of ongoing
research. It is by no means a definitive and exhaustive classification of the verb
inventory of English. Some of its limitations reflect explicit design decisions.
The verb classes were chosen because their members participated in diathesis
alternations or showed behavior that was closely related to that of other verbs
found in particular alternations. This strategy has led to the omission of certain
verbs and verb classes. This book also restricts itself to verbs taking noun phrase
and prepositional phrase complements. Verbs taking sentential complements
are for the most part ignored, except when they show interesting behavior with
noun phrase or prepositional phrase complements.10 Nor does this book look
systematically at verbs derived by productive morphological processes, such as
1 0 For some catalogs of verbs that take sentential complements, see Alexander and Kunz ( 1 964 ),
Bridgeman et al. ( 1 965), Ingria ( 1 987), Rudanko ( 1 989), Sager ( 1 98 1 ), among others.
Introduction 19
so-called zero-derived denominal verbs 1 1 and verbs derived through prefixation
(un-, de-, dis-, re-, etc.) or suffixation (-ify, -ize, -en, etc.). This study also
does not treat the inherent lexical aspect of verbs (aktionsart).12 The connection
between the verb classes and diathesis alternations discussed here and lexical
aspect needs to be carefully investigated, since lexical aspect also plays an
important part in determining verb behavior.
The material that is within the scope of this book is likely to contain inconsistencies,
omissions, arid inaccuracies, which reflect the practical difficulties
that face attempts to accurately and exhaustively carry out hypothesis checking
over a large number of English verbs. The set of verbs listed as belonging to any
given class does not necessarily exhaust the membership of that class, though
an effort has been made to make the lists as comprehensive as possible. It would
not be surprising to find disagreement over the inclusion of a certain verb in
a particular class, as well as differences of opinion concerning whether all the
members of a certain class do indeed manifest a particular property. What is
'important is the existence of core sets of verbs with specific sets of properties
that can provide the basis for the later identification of meaning components.
The goals of this work have also figured in the decision not to illustrate a
consistent set of properties across all the verb classes identified in Part II of
this book. Where information about a property is relevant it is included. For
instance, given that the verb fill expresses its arguments in a frame resembling
one of the variants of the locative alternation, and that as a first approximation
it seems rather similar in meaning to locative alternation verbs like spray and
load, it makes sense to include among the properties of fill's verb class that
its members do not undergo the locative alternation. However, the inclusion
of this information in the discussion of another class of verbs might merely
obscure the central properties of the members of this class. Similarly, in Part I
of the book only some classes of verbs that do not display a particular diathesis
alternation are noted.
Finally, this book does not assess the implications of the material it includes
for the identification of meaning . components, nor does it move beyond their
identification to the formulation of a lexical semantic representation. Rather, it
is intended to set the stage for these necessary next steps. In the meantime, I
hope that it will be a valuable resource for linguists and researchers in related
fields.

The Layout of the Book
This book consists of two major parts: a list of diathesis alternations and a
list of verb classes. It also contains a bibliography of relevant works and a verb
index. There is a certain area of overlap between the two major parts, because
they present the same material from different perspectives.
The presentation of material relies primarily on illustrative examples, with
written descriptions kept brief; however, comments signaling noteworthy properties
of verb classes and alternations have been included. Bibliographic
references have also been included where possible; these references should
provide a starting point for further investigations. Throughout this work, if the
illustrative examples given seem problematic, the reader should try substituting
another verb of the same type, in case the judgment simply reflects disagreement
about the classification of a particular verb. However, the reader needs to
keep in mind that verbs belonging to the same class are syntactic "synonyms."
That is, they should be substitutable in the same set of syntactic frames, though
not necessarily in exactly the same contexts.
Although different behavior with respect to a diathesis alternation is more
often than not a good reason to split a set of verbs into two subclasses, in some
instances where members of a set of verbs share all but one or two properties,
the class has not been subdivided further to avoid too much fragmentation
and the resulting loss of insight. In these circumstances, in Part I of the book,
when the relevant diathesis alternation is illustrated with respect to this class
of verbs, it is accompanied by an annotation indicating that it applies to only
some members of the class and that only the relevant verbs are listed. In Part II
of the book, when the relevant verb class is treated, the properties that do not
apply to the whole class are flagged.
22 Layout
Part 1: Alternations
This part of the book includes a wide variety of diathesis alternations characteristic
of English verbs, as well as special diatheses exhibited by certain English
verbs. Each diathesis alternation is exemplified upon introduction; often, too,
examples are given of verbs which might be expected to undergo the alternation
but do not. In an attempt to suggest semantic restrictions which may bear
on the alternations, the semantic classes of verbs which do and do not show
the alternation are identified, insofar as these are understood; If only some
members of one of the semantic classes undergo the alternation, only those
members are listed; a full list of members of such classes will be found in Part
II. Lists of verbs that do not undergo a particular alternation are preceded by
an asterisk; lists of verbs that undergo an alternation are not set off in a special
way. References to relevant discussions in the literature are included, as are
comments on noteworthy features of the alternations.
Most verbs mentioned in Part I of the book figure in one or more classes in
Part II. But a small number of verbs cited in Part I have not been associated
with a class in Part II because of limited or ill-understood behavior.
The alternations are subdivided into groups on the basis of the syntactic
frames involved. The first group includes transitivity alternations, while the
second group covers alternate expressions of arguments (mostly within the verb
phrase) that do not affect transitivity. A third group includes alternations that
arise when verbs permit "oblique" subjects. These major groups of alternations
are followed by a variety of other types.
Part II: Verb Classes
This part of the book contains various syntactically relevant, semantically
coherent verb classes of English. These classes are described individually. A
list of as many members of each class as possible is given; however, additional
class members are likely to exist in many instances. Lists considered to be
exhaustive are signaled by the word "only" following the last verb in the list. A
representative verb is then used to exemplify the characteristic properties of the
class, including argument-taking properties, behavior with respect to diathesis
alternations, and occasionally morphological properties (related nominals or
adjectives). These properties have been chosen to illustrate what is distinctive
to the members of that class. References to other discussions of the verb class
in the literature are provided where possible. Special properties of each class
are also signaled.
Some verbs have several meanings and therefore will be included in several
classes. Often when a verb has more than one meaning, one of its meanings is
basic and the others are systematically related to it; that is, they are instances
of extended meanings (see Introduction). Usually the ability to show particular
Layout 23
extended meanings is a property of a class of verbs, so where applicable, the
existence of related meanings is mentioned in the comments associated with
the description of a verb class. This phenomenon is not well understood, so no
attempt has been made to include extended meanings systematically.
This
·
part of the book is organized into sections that reflect a limited attempt
to group verb classes related by meaning together. However, there is little
hierarchical organization compared to the number of classes identified. This
lack of structure reflects not only the preliminary nature of the investigation, but .
also the fact that it is an open research question whether a complete hierarchical
organization of English verb classes is possible or even desirable (see Fellbaum
( 1 990) and G.A. Miller and Fellbaum ( 1 99 1 ) for some discussion).

Part One
Alternations
1 Transitivity Alternations
This section includes alternations involving a change in a verb's transitivity.
These alternations take the form 'NP V NP' alternating with 'NP V' or else
'NP V NP' alternating with 'NP V PP' . The question of whether the intransitive
use of the verb qualifies as unaccusative (ergative) or unergative (pure
intransitive) has been largely ignored. See Burzio ( 1 986), Grimshaw ( 1 987),
B. Levin and Rappaport ( 1 989), Perlmutter ( 1 978) for an overview of the
unaccusative/unergative distinction.
1.1 Object of Transitive = Subject of Intransitive Alternations
This subsection includes transitivity alternations taking the form of 'NP V NP'
alternating with 'NP V (PP)', where the semantic role of the subject of the
intransitive use of the verb is the same as the semantic role of the object of
the transitive use of the verb. This pattern has led some researchers to suggest
that these verbs are unaccusative in their intransitive use; that is, the surface
subject in the intransitive use has been claimed to be an underlying object.
These alternations have been split into three subtypes: the middle alternation,
a set of alternations labeled "causative alternations," and an alternation termed
the "substance/source" alternation.

Comments: The intransitive variant of this alternation, the middle construction,
is characterized by a lack of specific time reference and by an understood
but unexpressed agent. More often than not, the middle constructiqn includes
an adverbial or modal element. These properties distinguish the middle alternation
from the causative/inchoative alternation. In particular, the intransitive
variant of the causative/inchoative alternation, the inchoative construction, need
not have an understood agent, may have specific time reference, and does not
have to include adverbial or modal elements. However, there has been some
debate in the literature about whether there really is a middle alternation that
is distinct from the causative/inchoative alternation or whether there is only a
single alternation. Verbs that display the causative/inchoative alternation are
found in the middle construction, but there are a number of verbs found in the
middle construction that do not display the causative/inchoative alternation.
The middle alternation is described as being restricted to verbs with affected
objects. This constraint is used to explain the data above involving pound: the
object of this verb is not affected by the action of the verb, so that the verb is
found in the middle construction only in the presence of a resultative phrase,
which contributes a state that results from the action of pounding.
1.1.2 Causative Alternations
The next three subsections present "causative alternations," so called since they
involve verbs with transitive and intransitive uses, where the transitive use of
Section 1 . 1 .2 . 1 27
a verb V can be paraphrased as roughly "cause to V-intransitive." Two major
subtypes of causative alternations are usually distinguished in English: the
causative/inchoative alternation (sec. 1 . 1 .2. 1 ) and the induced action alternation
(sec. 1 . 1 .2.2). However, a wider range of verbs show both transitive and
intransitive uses related through the notion of "cause" than fit into these two categories;
consequently, a third subsection is included entitled "Other Instances
of Causative Alternations" (sec. 1 . 1 .2.3). Some alternating verbs that might
have been listed among the verbs showing the causative/inchoative alternation
in other work, but that do not clearly fit the semantic characterization of these
verbs, have been put into this subsection. This subsection also includes a variety
of verbs that are not commonly discussed from the perspective of transitivity
alternations.
In Part II of this book, when a verb shows one of the recognized subtypes
of the causative alternations (i.e., the causative/inchoative alternation or the
induced action alternation), the particular alternation is identified. If a verb is
identified as showing the causative alternation, then it shows an instance of the
alternation that does not qualify as an instance of one of the two recognized
subtypes (cf. sec. 1 . 1 .2.3). However, when a verb does not show any form of
the causative alternation, the indication given is "*Causative Alternations."

Comments: This alternation is known by a variety of other names, including
"anti-causative" and "ergative." C.S. Smith ( 1970) provides a good discussion
of the factors licensing this alternation and causative alternations in general.
The verbs undergoing the causative/inchoative alternation can roughly be characterized
as verbs of change of state or change of position. Selected verbs that
do not undergo the alternation have also been listed, including some verbs that
are only used transitively, such as verbs of change of possession, and some that
are only used intransitively, such as verbs of appearance, disappearance, and
occurrence. Few psych-verbs-verbs of psychological state-participate in the
causative/inchoative alternation in English, but all verbs of this type appear to
participate in the French, Italian, and Russian counterparts of this alternation;
see Ruwet ( 1 972) for a discussion of French psych-verbs. See also comments
under Middle Alternation above for a comparison of the causative/inchoative
and middle alternations.

run, swim, trot, walk
(24) a. Sylvia jumped the horse over the fence.
b. The horse jumped over the fence.
(25) a. The scientist ran the rats through the maze.
b. The rats ran through the maze.
Comments: This alternation is found primarily with a subset of the run
verbs. It differs from the causative/inchoative alternation in that the causee is
typically an animate volitional entity that is induced to act by the causer. Often
in the transitive variant the causer is understood not only to cause the causee to
move but also to be accompanying the causee. However, the accompaniment
interpretation is not necessary, as shown by the example involving rats in a
maze. Nevertheless, due to this potential interpretation, this alternation has
sometimes been referred to as the "accompanied causation" alternation.
In the transitive causative use, the verb must be accompanied by a directional
phrase. Even if such a phrase is not overtly expressed, it is understood.
For instance, Sylvia jumped the horse means that Sylvia jumped the horse over
something; it cannot mean that Sylvia made the horse jump in place. This property
sets the induced action alternation apart from other instances of causative
alternations.

(33) OTHER VERBS: bleed, burp
(34) a. I burped the baby.
b. The baby burped.
Comments: This section could be viewed as a "catchall" category that
includes all those verbs whose transitive use means roughly "cause to Vintransitive"
which do not fit into the other two types of causative alternations
identified here. Despite this negative characterization, many of the verbs listed
here do have something in common. With the exception of the suffocate verbs,
which may deserve separate treatment, these verbs are fel t to be basically
"intransitive" verbs describing internally controlled actions which in certain
circumstances can be externally controlled (caused), giving rise to the transitive
use of the verb. This characteristic is reflected in the fact that many of them
show a more limited range of objects in their transitive use than they show
subjects in their intransitive use, even though both types of arguments bear the
same semantic relation to the verb. For instance, as C.S. Smith ( 1 970) points
out, one can burp a baby, but not a doctor, although both babies and doctors
can burp.
1.1.3 Substance/Source Alternation
References: Pinker ( 1 989), Salkoff ( 1 983)
(35) VERBS OF SUBSTANCE EMISSION: belch, bleed, bubble, dribble, drip,
drool, emanate, exude, gush, leak, ooze, pour, puff, radiate, seep, shed,
spew, spout, sprout, spurt, squirt, steam, stream; sweat
(36) a. Heat radiates from the sun.
b. The sun radiates heat.
Comments: This transitivity alternation is only found with verbs of substance
emission. These verbs take two arguments: a source (emitter) and the substance
emitted from this source. Like the middle alternation and the causative
alternations, this transitivity alternation is characterized by the subject of the
intransitive form of the verb bearing the same semantic relation to the verb as
the object of the transitive form: in this instance, the substance emitted. Unlike
Section 1 .2. I 33
the middle alternation and the causative alternations, both arguments of the
verbs of substance emission are expressed in both the transitive and intransitive
uses of these verbs. Not only is the substance expressed in both, but the source
is expressed as the subject in the transitive use of the verb and as the object of
the preposition from in the intransitive use.
1.2 Unexpressed Object Alternations
This section includes transitivity alternations where the subject of the transitive
use of the verb bears the same semantic relation to the verb as the subject of ·
the intransitive use does. The intransitive variant in each of these alternations
involves an unexpressed but understood object. The different alternations in
this section have been recognized because each one is associated with a distinct
interpretation of the unexpressed object. However, further study may suggest
that some of these alternations should be collapsed. See also Fillmore ( 1986)
for some discussion of a range of constructions involving unexpressed objects
with definite interpretations, which might suggest the inclusion of an additional
category.

b. Mike ate. (􀠗 Mike ate a meal or something one typically eats.)
Comments: This alternation is manifested with a wide range of activity verbs.
Despite the Jack of overt direct object in the intransitive variant, the verb in
this variant is understood to have as object something that qualifies as a typical
object of the verb; however, there is some discussion concerning how best to
characterize this interpretation. There is also some debate about whe􀠘her the
understood object is or is not explicitly represented at some level of syntactic
or lexical representation. This alternation also often goes by names such as
"indefinite object" or "indefinite NP deletion" alternation.

b. * Tessa sprained.
Comments: This alternation is found with verbs describing conventionalized
gestures and signs made with a particular part of the body. These verbs take
this body part as their direct object in their transitive use. In their intransitive
use, the body part is understood but not expressed. Some of these verbs allow
a range of objects, including several body parts; however, usually only one of
these body parts is associated with the intransitive use. Interestingly, in Russian
many of these verbs mark the body part in the instrumental case rather than the
accusative case (see J.S. Levine ( 1 980)).

Comments: The action described by the verb in the intransitive variant of
this alternation is understood to be directed toward the subject of the verb; that
is, the intransitive variant can be roughly paraphrased by the combination of
the transitive use of the verb plus a reflexive object. This alternation is often
discussed with respect to Romance and Slavic languages, where the verb in
the intransitive variant is associated with an overt reflexive morpheme or clitic
(see Babby ( 1 975), Burzio ( 1 981 , 1 986), Kayne ( 1 975), among others). It is
possible that the alternation shown by the load verbs and push/pull verbs,
though superficially similar to that shown by the verbs of caring for the whole
body, may reflect a different phenomenon.

Comments: The action described by the verb in the intransitive variant of
this alternation can be roughly paraphrased by the transitive verb when it takes
the reciprocal each other as object. When used intransitively, these verbs must
take a collective NP as subject. There are additional restrictions on the subject
when the verb is used intransitively: all participants in the action must be of
comparable status. For instance, with some verbs, such as hug in example (6 1 )
above, each member of the group must be animate and able to participate in
initiating and carrying out the action. This alternation is often discussed with
respect to Romance and Slavic languages, where the verb in the intransitive
variant is associated with an overt reflexive morpheme or clitic (see Babby
( 1975), Burzio ( 1 98 1 , 1 986), Kayne ( 1 975), among others).

b. That movie always shocks.
Comments: In this alternation, the unexpressed object in the intransitive
variant receives what has been called an "arbitrary" or "PRO-arb" interpretation.
That is, this variant could be paraphrased with the transitive form of the verb
taking "one" or "us" or "people" as object. This alternation is restricted to verbs
with affected objects. It is found with a more limited set of verbs in English
than in Italian: primarily the verbs listed here. It is possible that not all the
psych-verbs listed above may participate.in this alternation.
Section 1.2.6.2
39
1.2.6 Characteristic Property Alternations
These two alternations are used to indicate that an agent pr instrument has a
propensity for or is suited to the action named by the verb.
1.2.6.1 Characteristic Property of Agent Alternation
References: Fellbaum and Kegl ( 1 989), Geniusiene ( 1 987). See Babby
( 1 975) for discussion of the same phenomenon in Russian.
(7 1) ALTERNATING VERBS: bite, butt, itch, kick, pinch, prick, scratch, sting
(72) a. That dog bites people.
b. That dog bites.
Comments: Both variants of this alternation are used to indicate that the
subject typically shows a propensity for the action named by the verb. That is,
the action named by the verb is in some sense characteristic of the subject. The
understood object in the intransitive variant is interpreted as something like
"people." The subject need not be animate. Interestingly, in Russian this use of
the verb involves the affixation of the reflexive morpheme -sja to the verb (see
Babby ( 1 975)). It is difficult to characterize precisely the set of verbs that show
this alternation, although it appears to be a fairly restricted set.
1.2.6.2 Characteristic Property of Instrument Alternation
References: Dixon ( 199 1 ), C.S. Smith ( 1970)
(73) clip, cook, cut, hammer, record, slice, pinch, prick, scratch, sting,

(74) a. I cut the bread with this knife.
b. This knife cut the bread.
c. This knife doesn't cut.
(75) a. This pen doesn't write.
b. These shears clip well.
c. This machine records well.
d. This oven cooks well. ·
e. This lotion softens, soothes, moisturizes, and protects.
f. This polish cleans, protects, and shines.

b. This key won't open the Jock.
(77) a. * This hammer won't break.
(on the interpretation where the hammer breaks something)
b. This hammer won't break the window.
40 Section 1 .2.7
Comments: The intransitive variant of this alternation is used to indicate
an instrument's suitability for carrying out the action named by the verb. This
alternation has not been collapsed with the characteristic property of agent
alternation because in this alternation the instrument is used by the agent to
carry out the action named by the verb, and it is not always capable of carrying
out the action alone. It is difficult to characterize the verbs that show this
alternation; they are drawn from a wide range of classes of verbs that may take
instruments, including the cut and carve verbs.
1.2.7 Way Object Alternation
References: Jackendoff ( 1 990b), B. Levin and Rapoport ( 1 988), Marantz
( 1 992)
(78) PusH/PULL VERBS (some): press, push, shove
(79) a. They pushed their way through the crowd.
b. They pushed through the crowd.
Comments: A large number of verbs can be followed by X' s way plus a
directional phrase; however, the members of the set of verbs given here appear
to have an intransitive use (see (79b)) that almost paraphrases the use of the
verb followed by X' s way (see (79a)).
1.2.8 Instructional Imperative
References: Atkins, Kegl, and B . Levin ( 1 988), Haegeman ( 1 987), Massam
and Roberge (1 989), Sadock ( 1 974)
(80) ALTERNATING VERBS: attach, bake, beat, boil, cook, cover, mix, pour,
put, remove, set, stir
(8 1 ) a. Bake the cake for 30 minutes.
b. Bake for 30 minutes.
(82) a. * Like the ice cream.
b. * Like after tasting.
Comments: This construction always requires the verb to be in the imperative.
Consequently it will not be found with verbs that do not allow the
· imperative. The instructional imperative construction is found with a wide
range of verbs that take an affected object. This property means that it is
not displayed by many other types of verbs, including verbs of perception or
admire-type psych-verbs. However, it is found with a much wider range of
verbs than many of the other alternations such as the unexpressed reflexive
and reciprocal object alternations. The understood object in the intransitive

variant receives its interpretation from context; generally, i t receives a definite
interpretation.

·Comments: The conative alternation is a transitivity alternation in which the
object of the verb in the transitive variant turns up in the intransitive conative
variant as the object of the preposition in a prepositional phrase headed by the
preposition at (sometimes on with certain verbs of ingesting and the push/pull
verbs). The use of the verb in the intransitive variant describes an "attempted"
action without specifying whether the action was actually carried out. The
conative alternation seems to be found with verbs whose meaning includes
notions of both contact and motion.

1.4 Preposition Drop Alternations
These transitivity alternations involve a verb found either in an intransitive
frame with a prepositional phrase complement or else in a transitive frame. The
transitive frame appears to be derived from the intransitive frame by "dropping"
the preposition.

directional phrase complements. These verbs are found intransitively with a
44 Section 1 .4.2
directional phrase or transitively with a path or goal (or in a few instances a
source) as direct object. It has been claimed that this alternation is associated
with the "holistic/partitive" effect associated with locative alternation verbs;
see Locative Alternation (sec. 2.3) for discussion. Specifically, the path or goal
argument receives a "holistic" interpretation when it is expressed as direct
object. To state this differently, when these verbs are found in the transitive
variant, the path is understood as being completely traversed or the goal as
attained.

Comments: A small set of verbs that involve potentially reciprocal actions
alternate between an intransitive form involving a prepositional phrase headed
by with and a transitive form that is an apparent paraphrase of the intransitive
form and seems to differ merely in the absence of the preposition with. Unlike
the locative preposition drop alternation, this alternation does not involve verbs
of manner of motion, but rather .involves certain verbs of social interaction.
Very few intransitive verbs that take a with complement allow this preposition
to "drop."

2 Alternations Involving Arguments Within the VP
This section includes a variety of alternations that do not involve a change in the
transitivity of the verb. All of these alternations are displayed by transitive verbs
taking more than one internal argument and arise because these verbs allow
more than one way of expressing these arguments. A few of these alternations
also show a second form involving intransitive verbs that can be seen as parallel
to the alternation with transitive verbs if the subject of the intransitive verb
plays the role of the object of the transitive verb in the alternation. If these
intransitive verbs are said to be unaccusative verbs, so that their surface subject
is an underlying object, then both the transitive and intransitive forms of the
alternations included in this section can be said to involve alternate expressions
of VP-internal arguments.

Comments: The dative alternationjs characterized by an alternation between
the prepositional frame 'NPl V NP2 to NP3' and the double object frame
'NP I V NP3 NP2' . The NP that is the object of the preposition to in the
prepositional frame turns up as the first object in the double object construction.
The dative alternation does not have an intransitive counterpart. There are
differences of opinion as to exactly which verbs show the alternation. For
instance, Gropen et al. ( 1 989) include the carry verbs among the verbs that do
not show this alternation, while Green ( 1 974) cites many of these verbs in her
list of alternating verbs.
48 Section 2.2
The dative alternation has been extensively studied. A major research issue
is the syntactic structure associated with the double object construction. In
addition, much of the discussion of the dative alternation has focused on constraints
on the alternation. Probably the most-discussed question concerns the
characterization of the set of verbs showing this alternation. Many, but not all,
of these are verbs of change of possession, where possession is rather broadly
construed. Related to this issue is the existence of a constraint sometimes
known as the Latinate restriction. This constraint involves the morphological
or phonological shape of the verbs undergoing the alternation: it appears that
verbs of Latinate origin that are found in the 'NP V NP to NP' frame are not
found in the double object construction. However, exceptions have been noted
to this particular generalization, and some researchers have tried to restate it
in tenns of other phonological and morphological properties of the verbs involved.
A variety of hypotheses are evaluated in Boguraev and Briscoe ( 1 989).
A second restriction on the dative alternation involves the nature of the goal
phrase. As illustrated above, there appears to be an animacy restriction on this
phrase, where the notion animate extends to include organizations and corporate
bodies. Thus, in example ( 1 1 7), the (b) sentence is acceptable if London is
used to represent via metonymy the London office of a company or the British
government (J. McCawley, personal communication).

Comments: This alternation resembles the dative alternation, and it is even
sometimes subsumed under it. It differs from the dative alternation in involving
the benefactive preposition for rather than the goal preposition to in the
prepositional variant. The benefactive alternation is found with verbs that can
broadly be characterized as either verbs of obtaining or verbs of creation, including
some verbs that are verbs of creation in an extended use. The studies of
this alternation show that the first object in a double object construction with a
benefactive alternation verb is less "object" -like in some respects than the first
object in a double object construction with a dative alternation verb. Like the
dative alternation, this alternation does not have an intransitive counterpart.

The locative alternation, like the dative alternation, has received considerable
attention. It is found with certain verbs that relate to putting substances on
surfaces or things in containers, or to removing substances from surfaces or
things from containers. The alternation involves the possible expressions of
what E. V. Clark and H. H. Clark ( 1 979) have called the locatum argument-the
substance or entity whose location is changed-and the location argument.
Specifically, in each variant one of these arguments is expressed as the object
of an appropriate preposition, while the second is not. The expression of the
second argument depends on whether the alternation is based on a transitive
verb or an intransitive verb: it is expressed as the object of the former and the
subject of the latter. The forms of the alternation manifested by transitive and
intransitive verbs can be viewed as a single alternation if the intransitive verbs
are given an unaccusative analysis, so that their subject is an underlying object.
One of the most-studied properties of the locative alternation is the so-called
"holistic/partitive effect." When the location argument is not expressed as the
object of a preposition, it is associated with what has been called a "holistic"
or "affected" interpretation; that is, the location is understood to be in some
sense "completely" affected by the action. The location does not necessarily
have to receive such an interpretation when it is expressed as the object of a
preposition. However, a number of studies have shown that providing a precise
characterization of this effect is not easy; specifically, they have shown that a
statement involving the notion "holistic" is not entirely a<icurate.

Comments: This form of the locative alternation is found with transitive verbs
relating to putting and covering. Like all forms of the locative alternation, it
manifests the "holistic/partitive" effect. The verb vest may be inappropriately
included; it appears to participate in the locative alternation, but unlike the other
verbs in this set, its locatum argument is typically an abstract noun phrase.

Comments: This form of the locative alternation is found with verbs that as
a first approximation are semantic inverses of the spray/load verbs. This form
of the alternation also displays the "holistic/partitive" effect. The object of the
verb receives the "holistic" interpretation in the of variant. The use of the of
variant is preferred when the locatum is abstract: clear someone of guilt!? clear
guilt from someone. The use of the passive also improves the acceptability of
the of variant. There are differences of opinion as to how large a class of verbs
shows this form of the locative alternation as opposed to the form shown by the
wipe verbs. For two different points of view compare the list in Hook ( 1983)
or Fraser ( 197 1 ) to that in B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 99 1 ). The list of
Section 2.3.4 53
alternating verbs given here reflects the more conservative approach taken in
B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav; however, certain wipe verbs can sometimes
show this alternation.
2.3.3 Wipe Alternation
( 1 36) Alternating Verbs: WIPE VERBS
a. MEANS SuBCLASS: bail, buff, dab, distill, dust, erase, expunge,
flush, leach, lick, pluck, polish, prune, purge, rinse, rub, scour,
scrape, scratch, scrub, shave, skim, smooth, soak, squeeze, strain,
strip, suck, suction, swab, sweep, trim, wash, wear, weed, whisk,
winnow, wipe, wring
b. INSTRUMENT SUBCLASS: brush, comb, file, filter, hoover, hose,
iron, mop, plow, rake, sandpaper, shear, shovel, siphon, sponge,
towel, vacuum
( 1 37) a. Helen wiped the fingerprints off the wall. (locative PP variant)
b. Helen wiped the wall (*of fingerprints). (locative object variant)
Comments : This form of the locative alternation is found with a set of verbs
that, like the clear verbs, could at a first approximation be considered semantic
inverses of the spray/load verbs. Howeyer, the wipe verbs, unlike the clear
verbs, do not allow the locatum argument to be expressed when the location
argument is expressed as the direct object. That is, they do not allow an of
phrase. This form of the locative alternation also displays the "holistic/partitive"
effect. The location argument receives the "holistic" interpretation when it is
expressed as the object of the verb. See the previous section on the transitive
clear alternation for a list of non-alternating verbs. This form of the alternation
has no intransitive counterpart.

congregate, convene, flock, gather, group, herd, huddle, mass
( 1 43) · a. The cattle are herding in the pasture.
b. * The pasture is herding with cattle.
Comments: This form of the locative alternation is displayed by intransitive
verbs, but it can be viewed as parallel to the form of the alternation displayed
by the spray/load verbs if the intransitive subject is seen as playing the role
that the object plays in the spray/load form Of the alternation. This form of the
locative alternation differs from the form displayed by the spray/load verbs in
lacking an agent. The swarm form of the alternation again is associated with the
"holistic/partitive" effect, but this time the "holistic'􀠕 interpretation is associated
with the subject of the with variant. See Salkoff ( 1 983) for extensive lists of
verbs showing this alternation. The non-alternating locative preposition-only
Section 2.4 55
verbs take collective NPs as subjects, and some of them are even zero-related
to collective nouns.
2.3.5 Clear Alternation (intransitive)
( 1 44) Alternating Verbs:
CLEAR VERBS (except clean) : clear, drain, empty
( 1 45) a. Clouds cleared from the sky. (locative variant)
b. The sky cleared (?of clouds). (of variant)
Comments: Just as the form of the locative alternation shown by the swarm
verbs is the intransitive counterpart of the form of the locative alternation shown
by the spray/load verbs, this form of the locative alternation is the intransitive
counterpart of the form of the locative alternation shown by the clear verbs
in their transitive use. The parallel is apparent if the intransitive subject in the
intransitive clear alternation is seen as playing the role that the object plays in
the transitive clear form of the alternation. In addition, the intransitive form of
the clear alternation lacks an agent. The clear verbs, then, participate in both
transitive and intransitive forms of the locative alternation.
This form of the alternation is again associated with the "holistic/partitive"
effect, but this time the "holistic" interpretation is associated with the subject
of the of variant. Unlike the transitive form of this alternation, its intransitive
form may be best in the absence of the of phrase, particularly with the verbs
drain and empty.
2.4 Creation and Transformation Alternations
References: Atkins, Keg!, and B. Levin ( 1988), Bertram ( 1 992), Dixon
( 1 99 1 ), Dowty ( 199 1 ), Fillmore ( 1 972), Gawron ( 1 983), Jackendoff ( 1 990b),
Jolly ( 1987), Nash-Webber ( 197 1 ), Napoli ( 1 989a)
This set of alternations is found primarily with verbs of creation and transformation.
There are two types of alternations, each with a transitive and an
intransitive form. As with the locative alternation, the subject of the intransitive
form of each type of alternation plays the same role as the object in the
transitive form of the alternation. In addition, the transitive form includes an
agent argument that is lacking in the intransitive form of the alternation. The
forms of the alternation manifested by transitive and intransitive verbs can be
viewed as a single alternation if the intransitive verbs are given an unaccusative
analysis, so that their subject is an underlying object.

( 1 53) Non-Alternating (neither variant possible):
* DESTROY VERBS: annihilate, blitz, decimate, demolish, destroy, devastate,
exterminate, extirpate, obliterate, ravage, raze, ruin, waste,
wreck
Comments: This alternation is found with transitive verbs taking an agent argument
expressed as subject and raw material and product arguments expressed
within the verb phrase. Both the raw material and product arguments may be
·expressed as either the direct object or the object of a preposition, typically into
for the product and out of or from for the raw material. Dixon ( 1 99 1 ) suggests
that the preposition with can be used instead of from or out of to introduce the
raw material in this alternation. A few of the verbs showing this alternation are
found in causative/inchoative pairs, and in their inchoative use they show the
intransitive form of the material/product alternation.

* TURN VERBS: alter, change, convert, metamorphose, transform, ·
transmute, turn
( 1 57) a. * He turned from a prince.
b. He turned into a frog.
Comments: This alternation is the form of the materiaVproduct alternation
that is manifested by intransitive verbs. The subject plays the part that the direct
object plays in the transitive form of this alternation. Unlike the transitive form,
there is no agent argument. Thus the raw material and product arguments may
be expressed either as the subject or as the object of a preposition, typically
into for the product and out of or from for the raw material. Most of the verbs
showing this alternation are found in causative/inchoative pairs, and in ·their
causative use they show the transitive form of the material/product alternation.

·
Comments: This alternation is found with transitive verbs. It differs from
the materiaVproduct alternation in involving three VP-internal arguments: the
entity undergoing a complete alternation and the initial state ("source") and final
state ("goal") of this entity. The entity undergoing the transformation is always
expressed as the direct object of the verb; the other arguments are expressed
in prepositional phrases. The final state always must be expressed, while the
initial state only optionally needs to be expressed. Most of the verbs showing
this alternation are found in causative/inchoative pairs, and in their inchoative
use, they show the intransitive form of the total transformation alternation.
2.4.4 Total Transformation Alternation (intransitive)
( 1 64) Alternating Verbs:

* GRow VERBS: develop, evolve, grow, hatch, mature
( 1 67) a. That acorn will grow into an oak tree.
b. * That acorn will grow from a seed into an oak tree.
Comments: This alternation is the form of the total transformation alternation
that is manifested by intransitive verbs. The subject plays the part that the direct
object plays in the transitive form of the alternation. There is no agent argument.
All of the verbs showing this alternation are found in causative/inchoative
pairs, and in their causative use, they show the transitiye form of the total
transformation alternation.

phenomenon in French.
Section 2.5. 1 59
Unlike the transitivity alternations involving reciprocal interpretations (sees.
1 .2.4, 1 .4.2), reciprocal alternations in this section do not involve a change in
verb transitivity. The verbs found in the various alternations involving reciprocal
interpretations here can appear either with or without a PP complement headed
by one of a range of prepositions. In the absence of the PP complement, the
subject, if the verb is intransitive, and the object, if the verb is transitive, must
be a collective NP-an NP that can have a group interpretation. The forms of
the alternation manifested by transitive and intransitive verbs can be viewed as
a single alternation if the intransitive verbs are given an unaccusative analysis,
so that their subject is an underlying object; the verbs found in the transitive ·
form of the alternation will take an agent argument that the verbs found in the
intransitive form lack. However, the unaccusative analysis may not be viable
for the social interaction verbs and the talk and chitchat verbs found in the
intransitive reciprocal alternations; the subjects of these verbs are typically
animate and volitional, unlike the typical subject of an unaccusative verb, and
these verbs do not have a transitive causative counterpart (with the exceptions
of marry and divorce).
There are additional restrictions on the participants when the verb is used
without a prepositional phrase complement: all participants constituting the
object NP if the verb is transitive, or the subject NP if the verb is intransitive,
must be of comparable status, as shown by the difference in acceptability in the
examples below.
( 168) a. The car collided with the bicycle.
The car and the bicycle collided.
b. The car collided with the fence.
* The car and the fence collided.

Comments: This alternation involves verbs found in two frames in a nearparaphrase
relationship: 'NPl V NP2 [pp P NP3] ' and 'NPl V [NP NP2 and
NP3] ' . The verbs have been grouped according to the preposition selected and
not according to semantic type. Most of the verbs showing this alternation are
drawn from the following classes: amalgamate verbs, mix verbs, and separate
verbs. Some of these verbs also are found in the together or apart reciprocal
alternations, while others are not.

Comments: This alternation involves verbs found in two frames in a nearparaphrase
relationship: 'NP l V NP2 [PP P NP3]' and 'NPl V [NP NP2 and
NP3] together' . The verbs have been grouped according to the preposition
selected and not according to semantic type. Most of the verbs found here
are drawn from the following classes: mix verbs, shake verbs, and tape verbs.
Verbs that take to phrases have been split into two groups: the verbs in the tape
class are all zero-related to nouns that name various items used to fasten two or
62 Section 2.5.3
more physical objects together, while the remaining verbs are not zero-related
to such nouns.
Together can be seen as a representative of a range of phrases indicating the
resulting configuration. It is possible that the together reciprocal construction
may tum out to be a type of resultative construction. Judgments regarding
the distribution of together do not seem to be totally clear, but it appears that
together is required with verbs of combining whose meaning includes a manner
component but not a result component.

found in two frames in a near-paraphrase relationship: 'NP l V (pp P NP2]'
and '[NP NP l and NP2] V ' . The verbs have been grouped according to the
preposition selected and not according to semantic type. Most of the verbs
found here are drawn from the following classes: correspond verbs, meet verbs,
talk verbs, chitchat verbs, amalgamate verbs, mix verbs, separate verbs, and
64 Section 2.5.5
differ verbs. There are also a variety of adjectives that could have been listed
here, as they behave in the same way as these verbs.
2.5.5 Together Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive)
( 1 89) Alternating Verbs:
a. P=with: band, blend, cluster, combine, commingle, concatenate,
connect, fuse, gather, glom, join, jumble, link, lump, mass, merge,
mingle, mix, pair, pool, speak, talk
b. P=into: blend, collect; cream, mix
c. P=to: add, bond, connect, f􀠔sten, fuse, join, link, stick
( 1 90) a. The eggs mixed with the cream.
b. The eggs and the cream mixed together.
( 1 9 1 ) Non-Alternating Verbs:
* AMALGAMATE VERBS:
P=with: affiliate, alternate, amalgamate, associate, coalesce, coincide,
compare, confederate, confuse, conjoin, consolidate, contrast, correlate,
criss-cross, entwine, entangle, harmonize, incorporate, integrate,
interchange, interconnect, interlace, interlink, interlock, intermingle,
interrelate, intersperse, intertwine, interweave, mate, muddle, ?pair,
rhyme, ?team, total, unify, unite
P=to: engage, introduce, marry, oppose, wed
( 1 92) a. Plays alternate with ballets.
b. · * Plays and ballets alternate together.
Comments: This alternation involves verbs found in two frames in a nearparaphrase
relationship: 'NPl V [pp P NP2]' and ' [NP NPl and NP2] V
together'. The verbs have been grouped according to the preposition selected
and not according to semantic type. Most of the verbs foun
·
d here are drawn
from the mix verbs and the talk verbs. The amalgamate verbs do not show this
possibility, even if they do allow an intransitive use. Judgments about the use
of together are not clear with the correspond and chitchat verbs, so these verbs
have not been included.
Together can be seen as a representative of a range of phrases indicating the
resulting configuration. It is possible that the together reciprocal construction
may turn out to be a type of resultative construction.
2.5.6 Apart Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive)
( 1 93) Alternating Verbs:
SPLIT VERBS: blow, break, draw, kick, knock, pry, pull, push, rip, roll,
shove, slip; split, tear, tug, yank
Section 2.6
( 1 94) a. The twig broke off (of) the branch.
b. The twig and the branch broke apart.
(on roughly the interpretation of the (a) sente.nce)
( 1 95) Non-Alternating Verbs:
65
a. * SEPARATE VERBS: decouple, differentiate, disconnect, disentangle,
dissociate, distinguish, divide, divorce, part, segregate,
separate, sever
b. * DIFFER VERBS: differ, diverge
( 1 96) a. The yolk separated from the white.
b. * The yolk and the white separated apart.
Comments: This alternation involves verbs found in two frames in a nearparaphrase
relationship: 'NP I V [rp P NP2]' and ' [Nr NP1 and NP2] V apart' .
Most of the verbs found here are drawn from the split verbs. The difef r verbs do
not show this possibility; nor do the separate verbs, even when they do allow
an intransitive use. The prepositions involved are the source prepositions from,
out (of), and off (of).
Apart can be seen as a representative of a range of phrases indicating the
resulting configuration. It is possible that the apart reciprocal construction may
turn out to be a type of resultative construction.

Most verbs that permit the dative alternation do not show this
alternation, including:
* VERBS OF FUTURE HAVING: advance, allocate, allot, assign, award,
bequeath, cede, concede, extend, grant, .guarantee, issue, leave, offer,
owe, promise, vote, will, yield
(200) a. The judge offered a prize to the winner.
b. * The judge offered the winner with a prize.

invest, ply, regale, reward, saddle
(202) a. * The judge saddled a prize to the winner.
b. The judge saddled the winner with a prize.
Comments: This alternation shows some superficial similarity to both the
dative alternation and the locative alternation. One of its variants involves
the 'NP V NP to NP' frame associated with the dative alternation. But the
other variant of the fulfilling alternation involves the frame 'NP V NP with
NP' , a frame associated with the form of the locative alternation found with
the spray/load verbs. Some of the verbs showing the fulfilling alternation also
show the dative alternation and are listed under that alternation. This alternation
does not have an intransitive counterpart.
2.7 Image Impression Alternation
References: Fraser ( 197 1 ), Rappaport and B. Levin ( 1 985)
(203) Alternating Verbs:
VERBS OF IMAGE IMPRESSION: applique, emboss, embroider, engrave,
etch, imprint, incise, inscribe, mark, paint, set, sign, stamp, tattoo
(204) a. The jeweller inscribed the name on the ring.
b. The jeweller inscribed the ring with the name.
(205) Non-Alternating Locative Preposition Only:
a. * SCRIBBLE VERBs: carve, chalk, charcoal, copy, crayon, doodle,
draw, forge, ink, paint, pencil, plot, print, scratch, scrawl, scribble,
sketch, spraypaint, stencil, trace, type, write
b. * TRANSCRIBE VERBS: copy, film, forge (signature), microfilm,
photocopy, photograph, record, tape, televise, transcribe, type
(206) a. The jeweller copied the name on the ring.
b. * The jeweller copied the ring with the name.
(207) Non-Alternating with Only:
* ILLUSTRATE VERBS: address, adorn, autograph, brand, date, decorate,
embellish, endorse, illuminate, illustrate, initial, label, letter,
monogram, ornament, tag
(208) a. * The jeweller decorated the name on the ring.
b. The jeweller decorated the ring with the name.
Comments: The image impression alternation superficially resembles the
spray/load form of the locative alternation and has sometimes been subsumed
Section 2.8 67
under this alternation. However, the verbs showing this alternation are a semantically
coherent subset of verbs whose meaning is somewhat different than that
of the spray/load verbs. Furthermore, the image impression alternation does
not appear to show the "holistic/partitive" effect associated with the locative
alternation. But if the lack of "holistic/partitive" effect can receive an independent
explanation, this difference may not be sufficient to consider the image
impression alternation a distinct alternation. This alternation does not have an
intransitive counterpart.

b. * BREAK VERBS: break, crack, crash, crush, fracture, rip, shatter,
smash, snap, splinter, split, tear
(214) a. Brian threw the stick against the fence.
b. * Brian threw the fence with the stick.
Comments: The verbs showing this alternation take three arguments that
as a first approximation might be characterized as an agent, a location, and
an instrument. The instrument is moved by the agent into contact with the
68 Section 2.9
location; thus the instrument also qualifies as a theme in the Gruber/Jackendoff
sense. The agent is always expressed as the subject. Either the location or the
instrument/theme may be the object of a verb participating in the alternation,
with the other argument expressed via a prepositional phrase. A hallmark of
this alternation is the use of the preposition against to head the prepositional
phrase expressing the location. This alternation does not have an intransitive
counterpart. Many of the verbs listed here come from Dowty ( 1 99 1 ).

b. Paula hit the fence with the stick.
Comments: The verbs showing this alternation, like those showing the
with/against alternation, take arguments that as a first approximation might
be characterized as an agent, a location, and an instrument. The instrument
is moved into contact with the location, thus also qualifying as a theme in
the Gruber/Jackendoff sense. But this alternation involves the use of a sharp
instrument that not only comes into contact with the location but also penetrates
it. The agent is always expressed as the subject. Either the location or the
instillment/theme may be the object of a verb participating in the alternation,
with the other argument expressed via a prepositional phrase. A hallmark of
this alternation is the use of the preposition through to head the prepositional
Section 2 . 1 0 69
phrase expressing the location. This alternation does not have an intransitive
counterpart.

Comments: The verb blame is the only verb attested in this alternation;
however, it is worth identifying this alternation since there are a wide range of
verbs that turn up in one of the frames associated with the alternation: 'NP V
NPfor NP'.

( 1 960), Sibley ( 1 955)
Verbs of searching seem to have available three alternate ways of expressing
their arguments: 'NPl V NP2 in NP3' , 'NP l V NP3for NP2 ' , 'NPl Vfor NP2
in NP3 ' . Different verbs of searching display different subsets of these patterns,
giving rise to a variety of alternations in the expression of their arguments.
Rather than labeling each of the attested subsets of the three frames as distinct
alternations, the different subtypes of verbs of searching are simply listed in
this section. Besides an agent argument, expressed as the subject, these verbs
take as arguments the entity being sought and the location where the search is
being carried out. The object sought and the location can be expressed either
as the direct object of the verb or within a prepositional phrase (headed by
for for the object sought and by a locative preposition for the location). One
of the possible frames arises when both of these arguments are expressed in
prepositional phrases simultaneously; the other two arise when one argument
is expressed as direct object and the other via a prepositional phrase. With the
exception of the ferret verbs, all of these verbs permit the use of a far phrase
to express the object sought.

(244) a. * The glass cut Rachel in the toe.
b. The glass cut Rachel's toe.
Comments: With certain verbs, the availability of two possible expressions
of a possessor and a possessed body part gives rise to this alternation. They
may be expressed as a single noun . phrase bearing the direct object relation
to the verb: the body part is the head of the noun phrase and the possessor is
expressed as a genitive possessor within the noun phrase. Alternatively, they
may be expressed as two distinct constituents: the possessor as direct object
and the body part in a prepositional phrase beaded by a locative preposition.
(In this variant, the possessor has "ascended" out of the body part NP, as
reflected in the name of this alternation.) This alternation is very similar to
the possessor-attribute factoring alternation with possessor object (sec. 2. 1 3 . 1
below). However, i t involves possessors and their body parts, while the factoring
alternation involves possessors and their attributes. Concomitantly, these two
alternations involve different prepositions (a locative preposition versus for)
and are found with rather different types of verbs.
2.13 Possessor-Attribute Factoring Alternations
These alternations involve both transitive and intransitive verbs. They arise because
a possessor and a possessed attribute may be expressed in two different
ways with certain verbs. As one option, they may be expressed in a single noun
phrase that depending on the alternation is either the direct object or the subject
of the verb. The attribute is the head of the noun phrase and the possessor is
expressed as a genitive possessor within the noun phrase. Alternatively, they
may be expressed separately (hence the label "possessor-attribute factoring"),
one as either the direct object or the subject and the other via a prepositional
Section 2. 1 3 . 1 73
phrase. There are three types of transitive possessor-attribute factoring alternations:
either the possessor or the attribute may be the direct object when they
are expressed separately or the possessor may be the subject when expressed
separately. However, the intransitive alternation always has the possessor as
subject.

Comments: This particular possessor-attribute factoring alternation involves
transitive verbs that allow the possessor and attribute to be expressed either as a
single noun phrase functioning as the direct object of the verb or as two distinct
constituents: the possessor as direct object and the attribute via a prepositional
phrase headed by for. This alternation is very similar to the body-part possessor
ascension alternation (sec. 2. 1 2). However, it involves possessors and
their attributes, while the possessor ascension alternation involves possessors
and their body parts. Concomitantly, these two alternations involve different
prepositions (jor versus a locative preposition) and are found with rather different
types of verbs. Deane and Wheeler ( 1 984) describe the possessor-attribute
factoring alternation as being found with verbs that "denote the direction of
attention toward some entity."

(260) a. They praised the volunteers for their dedication.
b. * They praise the dedication in the volunteers.
Comments: This alternation should probably not be recognized as a separate
alternation, because it arises simply as a consequence of the fact that the
admire-type psych-verbs show both possessor and attribute objects.

Comments: This type of possessor-attribute factoring alternation is manifested
by a set of transitive verbs, the amuse-type psych-verbs. This alternation .
involves the expression of a possessor and an attribute (or sometimes an activity)
of the possessor. The attribute/activity of the possessor is the cause of the
psychological state referred to by the verb. These verbs allow the possessor and
attribute/activity to be expressed either as a single noun phrase found as the
subject of the verb or as two distinct constituents, with the possessor expressed
as subject and the attribute expressed in a with phrase. In this alternation the
factoring sets up a relationship between the subject of the verb and a prepositional
phrase rather than between the object of the verb and a prepositional
phrase, in contrast to the other factoring alternations involving transitive verbs.
This alternation can also be viewed as an "oblique" subject alternation. It is
possible to draw a parallel between the instrument subject alternation (sec. 3.3)
and this alternation, with the with phrase playing the role of the instrument.
From this perspective, the cause of the psychological state can be expressed
either as an "oblique" subject or as a prepositional phrase.

(265) a. Meat fell in price.
b. The price of meat fell.
Comments: This alternation is the intransitive counterpart of the possessorattribute
factoring alternation with possessor object (sec. 2 . 1 3 . 1 ). Specifically,
the forms of the alternation manifested by transitive and intransitive verbs can be
viewed as a single alternation if the intransitive verbs are given an unaccusative
analysis, so that their subject is an underlying object; the verbs found in the
78 Section 2. 1 4
transitive form of the alternation will take an agent argument that the verbs found
in the intransitive form lack. In this form of the alternation, the relationship is
between an inanimate possessor and its attribute. The possessor and attribute
may be expressed using a single noun phrase bearing the subject relation to the
verb: the attribute is the head of this noun phrase, and the possessor is expressed
as a genitive possessor within the noun phrase. Alternatively, ihe possessor may
be expressed as subject, and the attribute may be expressed in a prepositional
phrase headed by in.

Comments: This alternation is manifested by transitive verbs that take complements
predicated of their direct object. The alternation arises because the
noun phrase that is predicated of the direct object may either be a bare noun
phrase or be expressed in an as phrase. Thus the alternation is characterized
by the two frames: 'NP V NP NP' and 'NP V NP as NP'. The frame 'NP V
NP NP' superficially resembles the double object frame associated with the dative
alternation. However, despite the superficial similarity the two frames are
typically given different syntactic analyses. The 'NP NP' sequence associated
with the as alternation is often analyzed as a small clause. The verbs found
in the dative alternation do not show this alternation, but they have not been
cross-listed here.
3 "Oblique" Subject Alternations
The alternations found in this section do not involve a change in transitivity, but
they do involve a change in the number of noun phrases found with the verb:
the verb is found with one less noun phrase in one variant than in the other.
These alternations involve verbs that have "agent" subjects, but that alternatively
may take as subjects noun phrases that can be expressed in some type of
prepositional phrase when the verb takes its canonical "agent" subject. Such
subjects have been referred to as "oblique" subjects because certain prepositional
phrases, particularly those expressing nonsubcategorized arguments, are
sometimes referred to as oblique phrases. When the verbs take the oblique
subject, the "agent" is no longer expressed. This section only includes a subset
of the verbs that show this phenomenon, listing some of the major subtypes.
3.1 Time Subject Alternation
References: Perlmutter and Postal ( 1 984)
(272) Alternating Verbs: see, find, inark, catch

3.2 Natural Force Subject Alternation
References: See references listed immediately below under Instrument
Subject Alternation.
80 Section 3.3
(274) a. I dried the clothes in the sun.
b. The sun dried the clothes.
Comments: "Oblique" subjects of this type have been characterized as "natural
forces." It is sometimes difficult to draw the line between noun phrases
that qualify as agents, natural forces, and instruments; there is some discussion
of this issue in the Case Grammar literature. The three notions have been kept
distinct here, although the question of whether this distinction is valid is by
no means settled. Typically, when expressed in a prepositional phrase, natural
forces cannot, or at least need not, tum up in a prepositional phrase headed
by the instrumental preposition with. Als􀠊, unlike instruments, natural forces
cannot tum up in use paraphrases; compare *f used the sun to dry the clothes
with I used the hair dryer to dry the clothes. Natural force subjects are not
illustrated in Part II of this book.

b. * The spoon ate the ice cream. (enabling/facilitating instrument)
(277) a. The crane loaded the truck. (intermediary instrument)
b. * The pitchfork loaded the truck. (facilitating instrument)
Comments: "Oblique" subjects of this type have been characterized as
"instruments." Various studies of the notion of instrument have made a distinction
between enabling (also called "facilitating") instruments, which cannot
tum up as subjects, and intermediary instruments, which can. Some verbs,
like eat or see, never take instrumental subjects because they only take enabling/
facilitating instruments. Some choices of instruments never tum up as
subjects, even though the verb in the sentence permits instrument subjects,
because they do not qualify as intermediary instruments, as shown by the
crane/pitchfork example in (277). Thus, whether an instrument may tum up
as subject depends both on the verb and the choice of instrument. See also
comments immediately above under Natural Force Subject Alternation.

3.4 Abstract Cause Subject Alternation
(278) Alternating Verbs: assert, confirm, demonstrate, establish, explain, imply,
indicate, justify, nullify,.obscure, proclaim, predict, prove, reveal,
show, suggest
(279) a. He established his innocence with the letter.
b. The letter established his innocence.
(280) His innocence was established by the letter.
Comments: The "oblique" subjects found in this alternation have been described
as "abstract causes." It is possible that this notion could be collapsed
with the notion of instrument, since abstract causes are expressed in with
phrases and play an instrument-like function, acting as an intermediary in the
event named by the verb. However, as their name reflects, abstract causes are
typically abstract rather than concrete NPs.

(282) a. I filled the pail with water.
b. Water filled the pail.
Comments: The term "locatum" is taken from E.V. Clark and H.H. Clark's
( 1 979) study of verbs zero-related to nouns. It is used by them to refer to the
locatum argument, the entity whose location is described by that verb. The
argument of the verb expressed in the with phrase or alternatively as an oblique
subject appears to satisfy this definition. Although it might be possible to argue
that the locatum phrases found with these verbs are actually instruments, since
they tum up in with phrases, and that the locatum subjects are just a special
82 Section 3 . 6
case of instrument subjects, there are several reasons for not referring to them
as such; see B . Levin and Rappaport ( 1 988).

locations. They are used with location subjects to describe the capacity of the
location with respect to the action named by the verb.

b. * Those new bricks constructed a house.
Comments: The raw material argument found with certain verbs of creation
can appear as subject when the product argument is expressed as the object. .
Sentences with raw material subjects are understood to be characterizing the
ability of the subject to be used in the action named by the verb.
3.9 Sum of Money Subject Alternation

(29 1 ) Alternating Verbs:
a. VERBS OF OBTAINING (some verbs): buy, charter, earn, find, get,

b. BUILD VERBS (a few verbs): build, make, sew
(292) a. I bought (you) a ticket for $5 .
b. $5 will buy (you) a ticket.
(293) a. The contractor will build (you) a house for $ 100,000.
b. $ 100,000 will build (you) a house.
Comments: The sum of money that is involved in certain financial transactions
can optionally be expressed as the subject of certain verbs describing such
transactions. This phenomenon is found with those verbs of obtaining where
the process of obtaining involves a transfer of money. When these verbs take
a sum of money subject, this sum is understood to be sufficient to allow the
transaction to take place.
3.10 Source Subject Alternation
(294) Alternating Verbs: benefit, profit
(295) a. The middle class will benefit from the new tax laws.
b. The new tax laws will benefit the middle class.

(297) a. The middle class will gain from the new tax laws.
b. * The new tax Jaws will gain the middle class.
Comments: Certain verbs of benefiting take as "oblique" subject the source
of the benefit. This type of "oblique" subject appears to be found with very few
verbs.

4 Reflexive Diathesis Alternations
This section describes regular changes in meaning that accompany the use of
reflexive pronouns as objects with certain verbs. In some instances, there are
others changes in the verb's argument-taking properties that accompany these
specialized uses of reflexive objects.
4.1 Virtual Reflexive Alternation
References: Fellbaum ( 1 989), Fiengo ( 1 980), Geniusiene ( 1 987), Hale and
Keyser ( 1987), Jespersen ( 1 949), G. Lakoff ( 1 977), Lee ( 197 1 ), Williams
( 1 98 1 )
(298) a. The butcher cuts the meat.
b. This meat cuts itself.
(299) a. The butler polished the silver.
b. This silver polishes itself.
(300) a. The audience watched the movie.
b. * This movie just watches itself.
(30 I ) a. The boy opened the window.
b. This window just opens itself.
(302) a. The heat melted the ice cream.
b. * This ice cream just melts itself.
(303) a. This book just sells itself.
b. * This book just buys itself.
Comments: In the virtual reflexive construction, the subject bears the same
semantic relation to the verb as the object does in the typical transitive use
of the verb. However, unlike other constructions with this property, the verb
does not change transitivity but instead takes a reflexive pronoun as object.
The argument that is the subject of the typical transitive use of the verb is not
expressed. The virtual reflexive construction seems to be 􀠋imilar to the middle
construction in meaning, but the set of verbs that appear in this construction
is not co-extensive with the set of verbs appearing in the middle construction.
'In fact, the set of verbs found in this construction is quite restricted and not
easily tied to particular semantic classes of verbs. For instance, Fellbaum (1 989)
points out that some alternating verbs of change of state (sees. 45. 1-45.4) show
this alternation (e.g., shut, open) while others do not (e.g., melt).
4.2 Reflexive of Appearance Alternation
References: Geniusiene ( 1 987), Poutsma ( 1904), Sigler ( 1 985)
Section 5
(304)
(305)
85
REFLEXIVE VERBS OF APPEARANCE: assert, declare, define, express,
form, manifest, offer, pose, present, proffer, recommend, shape, show,
suggest
a. I presented a solution to the problem yesterday.
b. A solution to the problem presented itself yesterday.
Comments: When verbs undergoing this alternation are found with reflexive
objects, their subject bears the same semantic relation to the verb as the object
does in the ordinary transitive use. The argument that is the subject of the
typical transitive use of the verb is not expressed. This construction is used to
describe coming into existence or appearance on the scene. The verbs showing
this property can all be used transitively.

(3 1 3) a. A pirate ship appeared on the horizon. (unaccusative 􀠍erb)
b. * The horizon was appeared on by a pirate ship.
Comments: This type of passive construction is found primarily with intransitive
verbs. The discussions of these passives have focused on identifying the
criteria that determine whether an intransitive verb will or will not be found in
the prepositional passive construction. A verb's eligibility appears to depend on
the nature of the verb itself and the nature of the prepositional phrase. CouperKuhlen
( 1979) looks at constraints on the semantic roles of the arguments of
intransitive verbs and suggests that one restriction on this construction is that
the verb must allow an animate subject. It has also been proposed by Perlmutter
and Postal ( 1984) that only unergative verbs (those intransitive verbs whose
surface subject is an underlying subject) and not unaccusative verbs (those
intransitive verbs whose surface subject is an underlying object) are found in
prepositional passives. But not all supposedly unergative verbs allow prepositional
passives; these restrictions must be explained. Sentences with adjunct
prepositional phrases do not have prepositional passive counterparts.

b. The pillow remained stuffed with feathers.
(3 15) broken glass, unsent letters, cut flowers
(3 16) unsold cars, *unsold customers
Comments: Certain passive participles show adjectival properties; these are
termed "adjectival passives." Just as with verbal passives, all obligatory complements
of the verb must be expressed in order to have a well-formed adjectival
passive. There is some debate about whether a notion of "adjectival passive"
that is distinct from "verbal passive" should be recognized.

Comments: The adjectival perfect participles formed from certain intransitive
verbs have been included in the section on passives since they are formed
with the perfect morpheme -ed, which is homophonous with, if not the same
morpheme as, the passive morpheme. The question is whether there is some
relation between the process forming such adjectival perfect participles and
the process forming adjectival passive participles. Another open issue concerns
the characterization of the intransitive verbs that have related adjectival perfect
participles. It has been proposed that only unaccusative verbs may have
related adjectival perfect participles (although not all do), but that unergative
verbs may not. There is disagreement about whether the process of forming
88 Section 6
-ed participles from intransitive verbs is a productive process, even within the
appropriately restricted set of verbs.
6 Alternations Involving Postverbal "Subjects"
These two alternations involve constructions where the subject of the verb
occurs after the verb. The two alternations differ as to what becomes the surface
subject. The verbs found in these constructions are primarily intransitive and
passive transitive verbs. Very few transitive verbs are attested. There is a third
type of alternation involving a postverbal subject, quotation inversion, as in
"/ think that Wanda forgot to come," said Mathilda. This alternation is not
included here since it involves sentential complement-taking verbs. See Green
( 1980), Hartvigson and Jakobsen ( 1 974), Penhallurick ( 1984), and Zwicky
( 197 1 a), among others.

Comments: The hallmark of the there-insertion construction, which is typically
found with intransitive and passive verbs, is the presence of there before
the verb and the postverbal appearance of a noun phrase which would otherwise
appear as the surface subject. Sever􀠎l properties of this construction have
Section 6 . 1 9 1
been widely investigated. One is the so-called Definiteness Effect, roughly the
requirement that an immediately postverbal NP in the there-insertion construction
be indefinite (though there is some controversy over how this term is to be
defined). A second much-studied property involves the characterization of the
set of verbs found in this construction. The prototypical intransitive verbs found
in the there-insertion construction have been described as verbs of existence
and appearance. Not all of the verbs that allow this construction appear to meet
this characterization readily in their basic sense, but it has been suggested that .
they all show an existence or appearance sense when found in this construction.
However, change of state verbs appear to be incompatible with it. Milsark
( 1 974) points out that although some of the verbs found in the there-insertion
construction are basically change of state verbs (e.g., break, grow, open), they
lose the change of state interpretation in this construction and are understood
as verbs of existence or appearance. Some passive verbs and a few transitive
verbs also permit this construction; these are generally drawn from classes
that can be seen to be compatible with the overall semantic constraints on the
verbs found in it. The semantic make-up of the set of verbs found in this construction
together with the presence of an immediately postverbal NP with at
least some verbs has led some to propose that the there-insertion construction
is an unaccusative diagnostic (Burzio (1 986), L. Levin ( 1 986, 1 987), among
others).
Most of the verbs found in the there-insertion construction must cooccur
with a prepositional phrase. Less thoroughly studied is the possible position
of this prepositional phrase. There are three possible positions: sentence-initial
preceding there, immediately after the verb but before the NP, or following a
postverbal NP. However, not every position is available with every type of verb.
For instance, Aissen ( 1 975) points out that some verbs are only found in this
construction if the postverbal NP follows (rather than precedes) the PP. This
seems to be the case with the run verbs; see also Burzio ( 1 986). Bresnan ( 1 990)
also points out that the PP cannot precede there with the run verbs.
A representative list of verbs that can be found in this construction, grouped
into semantically coherent classes, is identified above. The same list of verbs has
been included under both There-Insertion and Locative Inversion (below), with
the exception of the transitive verbs found in each of these constructions. This
decision was motivated by the considerable overlap between the verbs found
in the two constructions. However, further research is necessary to determine
whether the classes of verbs found in the two constructions really are coextensive.
The lists includt; almost exclusively members of the classes that
have been attested in the literature in one of the constructions; Hartvigson and
Jakobsen ( 1974) and a corpus collected at Northwestern University are the
sources for many of these verbs. Some of the verb classes identified here are
broken down further in Part II of this book.

Comments: The superficial characteristics of this construction suggest that it
is aptly named "locative inversi on." It is typically found with certain intransitive
verbs and passive verbs that take locative and directional prepositional phrase
complements, and it is characterized by a preverbaL prepositional phrase and a
postverbal noun phrase which bears the same relation to the verb as the surface
subject does when the verb is not used in this construction.
There has been much discussion of the set of verbs found in this construction,
and the comments above concerning the set of verbs found in the there-insertion
construction carry over to locative inversion. That is, the set of verbs found in
this construction have been characterized as verbs of existence and appearance.
Some of the attested verbs do not readily fi t this characterization, but it has been
suggested that they show an existence or appearance sense when found in this
construction. Milsark's observation ( 1 974) that verbs of change of state (e.g.,
break, grow, open) receive a verb of existence or appearance interpretation
when they are found in the there-insertion construction extends to the locative
inversion construction. As with the there-insertion construction, there has been
some debate over whether or not this construction is an unaccusative diagnostic;
Bresnan ( 1990) and T. Hoekstra and Mulder ( 1 990) are among those .who argue
that it is, while Rochemont and Culicc:>ver ( 1 990) take the opposing position.
A representative list of verbs that can be found in this construction, grouped
into semantically coherent classes, is identified above. The same list of verbs
has been included under both There-Insertion and Locative Inversion, with the
exception of the transitive verbs found in each of these constructions. This
decision was motivated by the considerable overlap between the verbs found

whether the classes of verbs found in the two constructions really are coextensive.
The lists include almost exclusively members of the classes that
have been attested in the literature in one of the constructions; Hartvigson and
Jakobsen ( 1974) and a corpus collected at Northwestern University are the
sources for many of these verbs. Some of the verb classes identified here are
broken down further in the verb class part of this book.

(350) a. Heather grunted.
b. ? Heather grunted a disinterested grunt.
Comments: Some basically intransitive verbs take as their object a noun
that is zero-related to the verb-a so-called "cognate object." Usually, the
cognate object itself does not appear to make a contribution to the meaning
96 Section 7.2
of the sentence. However, cognate objects are best when they are modified by
an adjective or other modifier, and the modifier makes a contribution to the
meaning of the sentence: the modifier functions rather like an adverbial. Most
verbs that take cognate objects do not take a wide range of objects. Often they
only petmit a cognate object, although some verbs will take as object anything
that is a hyponym of the cognate object.
Cognate objects are found with many verbs of nonverbal expression, as well
as with a variety of other activity verbs. Zwicky ( 1 97 l a) writes that verbs of
manner of speaking take cognate objects, but there seem to be differences of
opinion about whether such objects are indeed permitted; it is also possible that
members of this class might behave differently in this respect.

(359) a. * The cook boned the fish of bones.
b. * The cook boned the fish of its backbone.
Comments: A "cognate" prepositional phrase may be found with certain
verbs that are zero-related to nominals. In most instances, these phrases are
headed by the preposition with, and the verbs taking such phrases fall into
two major classes: verbs whose meaning cim be paraphrased as "put X on/in
something" and verbs whose meaning can be paraphrased as "attach with X,"
where X is the noun that the verb takes its name from. In addition, the verbs
mine and quarry can take cognate source phrases.
The object of the preposition is an NP headed by the noun that the verb takes
its name from or a noun that bears the hyponym relation to the noun that the
verb derives its name from. Such cognate prepositional phrases are typically
most acceptable if they contribute additional information through the use of a
modifier of some kind.

Comments: Certain intransitive verbs-particularly verbs of manner of
speaking and verbs of gestures and signs-take nonsubcategorized objects
that express a reaction (an emotion or disposition); possible objects include:
approval, disapproval, assent, admiration , disgust, yes, no. When these verbs
take such objects they take on an extended sense which might be paraphrased
"express (a reaction) by V-ing," where "V" is the basic sense of the verb.
For instance, She mumbled her adoration can be paraphrased as "She expressed/
signalled her adoration by mumbling." Most of the verbs that allow
such reaction objects name activities that are associated with particular emotions,
and the action they name is performed to express the associated emotion.
The exceptions are the verbs of emission, which also show this phenomenon to
a limited extent. Reaction object constructions do not have passive counterparts.

Comments: Certain verbs can take a noun phrase of the form "X 's way" as
object when it is followed by a prepositional phrase describing a resulting state
or location. This construction has attracted interest because it appears to be an
unaccusative diagnostic: it is found only with unergative and transitive verbs,
not with unaccusative verbs. It shows certain resemblances in its distribution
and its syntax to the resultative construction and might be subsumed under that
construction.

Comments: A resultative phrase is an XP which describes the state achieved
by the referent of the noun phrase it is predicated of as a result of the action
named by the verb. The examples above show the distribution of resultative
phrases with different types of verbs. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that
resultative phrases cannot be predicated of the subjects of transitive verbs.
They can, however, be predicated of the subjects of passive verbs and the ·
subjects of some intransitive verbs. They also cannot be predicated of obliques.
Some researchers have explained this pattern by adopting the Unaccusative
Hypothesis; the basic insight then is that a resultative phrase may be predicated
of an underlying object of a verb, but may not be predicated of its subject or
of an oblique complement. Van Valin ( 1 990) proposes an alternative semantic
account of the pattern.
A wide range of verbs is found in the resultative construction, so no specific
classes of verbs are identified here. However, there are also some clearly
semantic constraints on the verbs found in the resultative construction: stative
verbs and directed motion verbs are excluded. When intransitive unergative
verbs are found in resu1tative 􀀣onstructions, they may display a variety of types
of postverbal NPs, as shown above.
7.6 Unintentional Interpretation of Object
When certain verbs take either a reflexive object or a body-part object possessed
by the subject of the verb, the sentence containing the verb assumes a
special reading that is characterized here as "unintentional," although a more
precise characterization might be possible. Although such verbs typically take
an agentive subject, in this construction the subject of the verb is not intentionally
performing the action on himself or herself and has been characterized as
an experiencer or even a patient.

spank, strap, thrash, truncheon, wallop, whip, whisk
Pauline spanked herself.
(unambiguous: only intentionally)
(383) * BREAK VERBS: break, chip, crack, crash, crush, fracture, rip, shatter,
smash, snap, splinter, split, tear
Pauline broke herself (on the tree).
(unambiguous: only intentionally)
(384) * ToucH VERBS: caress, graze, kiss, lick, nudge, pat, peck (=kiss), pinch,
prod, sting, stroke, tickle, touch

(unambiguous: only intentionally)
(385) HURT VERBS (some): bruise, bump, burn, cut, hurt, injure, nick, prick,
scald, scratch
Tessa hurt herself.
(ambiguous: intentionally or unintentionally)
Comments: This construction is characterized by an "unintentional" interpretation
that is manifested when certain verbs take a reflexive object. That is,
in this construction the subject of the verb, although usually taken as an agent, is
not understood to be intentionally performing the action on himself or herself.
For instance, the unintentional reading of Pauline hit herself on the doorframe
would describe a situation where Pauline runs into a room and accidentally hits
herself against the doorframe. As pointed out to me by J. McCawley (personal
communication), this phenomenon reflects the ability of English to use expressions
denoting a person to refer to that person's body (see Nunberg ( 1 978));
this possibility is not available in all languages (for example, not in Korean, as
described by Na ( 1 986)). The unintentional interpretation of reflexive objects is
found with a more restricted range of verbs than the unintentional interpretation
of a body-part object (see below).

(ankle, back, knee, wrist), strain, stub (toe), tum (ankle), twist (ankle)
Tessa sprained her ankle.
(ambiguous: intentionally or unintentionally)
Comments: This construction is characterized by an "unintentional" interpretation
that manifests itself when certain verbs take a body-part object. In this
construction, the subject is understood to be the possessor of the body part, and
the action named by the verb is not intentionally carried out by the subject on
the body part. For instance, the unintentional reading of Carrie hit her elbow
on the doorknob could describe a situation where Carrie runs into a room and
accidentally hits her elbow against the doorknob. (This sentence is also open
to an interpretation in which the possessor of the body part is someone other
1 04 Section 7.7
than the subject; that interpretation is not relevant here.) Although this special
interpretation is associated with particular classes of verbs, it is not available
to all members of each class. This property may reflect the fact that body parts
are not possible objects of all the verbs in each of the classes.

Comments: In sentences with certain transitive verbs taking both a noun
phrase and a prepositional phrase complement, a pronoun in the prepositional
phrase may or must be understood as coreferent with the subject. This possibility
is not allowed by Binding Theory (Chomsky ( 1 98 1 )), which requires a
reflexive in this position for the coreferential interpretation. In fact, with some
of these verbs the reflexive pronoun cannot be used.to express the coreferential
interpretation, despite the apparent predictions of Binding Theory. Verbs like
contain only show this behavior when they take a container as subject.

Comments: Certain verbs that are not inherently verbs of displacement in a
particular direction may take on a meaning that involves directed displacement
when they are found with a directional or goal prepositional phrase. In the
presence of such a prepositional phrase, the verb takes on an extended sense
that might be paraphrased as "go by V-ing." (Note that even the run verbs
only indicate displacement in a parti􀠒ular direction when they combine with a
directional or goal phrase.) In the absence of a goal phrase, the verbs showing
this phenomenon are activity verbs in the Vendler ( 1 957) sense; in the presence
of such a phrase, they are accomplishments. This shift in aspectual class is most
often discussed with respect to the run verbs and the push/jntll verbs, but it is
attested with a wider range of verbs, as shown by the examples.
This phenomenon has been studied from several perspectives. It is frequently
discussed in the literature on aktionsart, since the addition of goal phrases
changes atelic verbs to telic verbs. It has also been examined by Talmy ( 1 975,
1985) in his study of lexicalization patterns. Talmy shows that the phenomenon
is not attested in all languages. More recently, the observation has also attracted
attention in the literature on the Unaccusative Hypothesis, since the addition
of such phrases seems to cause the run verbs to shift from the unergative
to the unaccusative class. There may be other types of verbs showing this
phenomenon.
Section 8.3 1 07
8 Verbs Requiring Special Diatheses
This section includes verbs that place special restrictions on the syntactic
context they are found in. The verbs are grouped according to the type of
context they require.
8.1 Obligatory Passive
References: Bach ( 1 980), Stein ( 1979)
(41 3) reincarnate, rumor, repute
(414) a. It is rumored that he left town.
b. * They rumor that he left town.
Comments: These verbs are obligatorily found in the passive.
8.2 Obligatorily Reflexive Object
References: Baldi ( 1 97 1 ), Currne ( 1 93 1 ), Dougherty ( 1 970), Emonds ( 1976),

Lees and Klima ( 1963), Poutsma ( 1904), Quirk et al. ( 1 985)
( 4 1 5) absent, acquit, assert, avail, bear, behave, bestir, betake, bethink, better,
busy, camouflage, carry, check, collect, comport, compose, conduct,
contain, content, defend, demean, disgrace, disport, efface, embroil,
endear, enjoy, ensconce, excel, exert, fancy, find, help, ingratiate, insinuate,
intoxicate, intrude, inure, justify, lower, martyr, nerve, outdo,
overreach, perjure, plight, pride, profess, prostrate, redeem, relieve,
resign, revenge, steel, sun, unbosom, vindicate, worm
( 4 1 6) a. The politician perjured himself.
b. * The politician perjured his aide.
Comments: These verbs obligatorily take the reflexive pronoun as object.
Some of them may be found with an object that is not a reflexive, but when
they are, they show a different meaning. However, a few of the verbs listed here
are also found with the same meaning in the passive-probably the adjectival
passive. Consider, for example, the verb embroil: He embroiled himself in the
latest controversy over the budget, He was embroiled in the latest controversy
over the budget.

(ankle, back, knee, wrist), strain, stub (toe), tum (ankle), twist (ankle)
a. Jennifer craned her/* his neck.
b. Jennifer craned her neck!* arm.
Comments: These verbs, at least on the intended interpretation, take as
their object a body part which is inalienably possessed by the subject of the
verb. They fall into two major classes: either they describe gestures or signs
performed with a part of the body or they describe damage inflicted to a part
of the body.
Section 8.6 1 09
8.4 Expletive It Object
References: Bladin ( 1 9 1 1 ), Postal and Pullum ( 1 988), Pullum ( 1 987), Stroik
( 1 990)
(42 1 ) a. Let's call it a day.
b. They've got it made.
c. You've really lived it up.
Comments: Verbs such as in the above examples take expletive it as an ·
object in at least one interpretation. Many verbs may take expletive it as one
of a range of objects, but there are some verbs, particularly certain verbs that
are zero-related to nouns, that can only take it as an object; for example, to
lord it over someone. See Postal and Pullum ( 1 988) for an extensive list of
examples of verbs taking expletive it objects, subdivided into classes according
to complement type.
8.5 Obligatory Adverb
References: McConnell-Ginet ( 1 982), Napoli ( l 989a)
(422) acquit, act, augur, behave, bode, do, mean, phrase, treat, word
(423) a. The teacher meant well.
b. * The teacher meant.
Comments: These verbs always require an appropriate adverb, at least on the
relevant interpretation. They can be subdivided further according to whether or
not they require a direct object.
8.6 Obligatory Negative Polarity Element
(424) budge
(425) a. The horse wouldn't budge.
b. Would the horse budge if you pushed?
c. * The horse budged.
Comments: These verbs must be found in the context of a negative polarity
item. This requirement is not strictly a requirement on a verb's argument-taking
properties; nevertheless, this set of verbs has been included here since such a
requirement probably does reflect some aspect of their meaning.

References: Croft ( 199 1 ), Dixon ( 1 99 1 ), Gruber ( 1976), Jackendoff ( 1 985a)
9.1 Put Verbs
Class Members: arrange, immerse, install, lodge, mount, place, position,
put, set, situate, sling, stash, stow

( 1 ) I put the book on/under/near the table.
(2) a. * I put the book to Sally.
b. * I put the book from Edna.
c. * I put the book from Edna to Sally.
(3) * Locative Alternation:
a. I put books on the table.

(on the interpretation where something is placed on the table)
112 Section 9.2
(8) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a position, a lodge
Comments: These verbs refer to putting an entity at some location. The
location is expressed via a prepositional phrase headed by one of a range of
locative prepositions; however, the preposition heading this phrase cannot be
the goal preposition to or the source preposition from. These verbs do not
have related intransitive uses. Some of them have zero-related nominals; these
nominals have a variety of meanings.
9.2 Verbs of Putting in a Spatial Configuration
Class Members: dangle, hang, lay, lean, perch, rest, sit, stand, suspend
Properties:
(9) Cheryl stood the books on the shelf/next to the magazines.
( 1 0) a. * Cheryl stood the books to Sarah.
b. * Cheryl stood the books from Edna.
c. * Cheryl stood the books from Edna to Sarah.
( 1 1 ) * Locative Alternation:
a. Cheryl stood the books on the shelf.
b. * Cheryl stood the shelf with (the) books.
( 1 2) * Middle Alternation:
a. Cheryl stood the tall books on the table.
b. * Tall books stand on tables easily.
(on the relevant interpretation)
( 1 3) Causative Alternation (most verbs):
a. Cheryl stood the books on the table.
b. The books stood on the table.
( 1 4) ? Cheryl stood the books.
( 1 5) * Cheryl stood on the table.
(on the interpretation: something is placed on the table by Cheryl)
( 1 6) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a perch, a stand
* a dangle, *a hang
Comments: These verbs refer to putting an entity at some location. What
sets this class of verbs apart from other verbs of putting is that they specify the
particular spatial configuration that the placed entity ends up in with respect to
the location. They occur with a variety of locative prepositional phrases, but
Section 9.3 113
not with source or goal phrases. The verbs dangle, hang, and suspend do occur
with the preposition from, but this is not the from found in source phrases. A
few of these verbs have zero-related nominals referring to objects used to place
other objects in the particular spatial configuration named by the verb; that is,
the noun stand names what one stands something on.
Most of these verbs l1ave intransitive uses as verbs of spatial configuration;
the properties associated with these uses are listed under Verbs of Spatial Configuration
(sec. 47.6). The intransitive use has been included here under the
label "causative alternation." This alternation is not the causative/inchoative alternation
since the intransitive use does not have the change of state or change
of location (with displacement) interpretation that is associated with the intransitive
variant of the prototypical verbs showing the causative/inchoative
alternation. When one of the verbs listed in this section cannot be used intransitively,
there is typically another verb that carries the meaning associated
with the intransitive use, as in the pair lay/lie. Some of these verbs, such as
hang or sit, also are used intransitively as verbs of assuming a position and are
cross-listed accordingly (sec. 50).
9.3 Funnel Verbs
Class Members: bang, channel, dip, dump, funnel, hammer, ladle, pound,
push, rake, ram, scoop, scrape, shake, shovel, siphon, spoon, squeeze, squish,
squash, sweep, tuck, wad, wedge, wipe, wring
Properties:
( 1 7) I funneled the mixture into the bottle.
?? I funneled the mixture in the bottle.
( 1 8) a. * I funneled the mixture from the bottle. (some exceptions)
b. * I funneled the mixture to Rina.
c. * I funneled the mixture from Edna to Rina.
( 1 9) * Locative Alternation:
a. I funneled the mixture into the bottle.
b. * I funneled the bottle with the mixture.
(20) * Middle Alternation:
a. I funneled the mixture into the bottle.
b. * The mixture funnels easily.
(2 1 ) * Causative Alternations:
a. I funneled the mixture into the bottle.
b. *The mixture funnels.
(22) * I funneled the mixture.
114 Section 9.4
(23) * I funneled into the bottle.
(on the interpretation where something is funneled into the bottle)
(24) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a funnel (instrument)
a wad (result)
Comments: These verbs relate to putting an entity in some location in some
manner; usually they involve putting entities in spatially confined locations.
These verbs, unlike the put verbs, show a preference for into rather than in and
for onto rather than on, though they can otherwise be found with a wide range
of locative prepositions. Again, these verbs are not found with to. Some of
these verbs can also be used as verbs of removing, taking from; these verbs are
listed under the wipe verbs (sec. 1 0.4 ). Unlike the verbs of putting in a spatial
configuration, Junne/ verbs are vague about the resulting spatial configuration
of the entity placed. Some of these verbs have zero-related nominals. These
nominals are of two types: they either specify an instrument used to perform
the action referred to by the verb, or they refer to a quantity of stuff that is
inserted into the location. Some of these verbs, including bang or pound, are
used as verbs of putting in an extended sense; in their basic sense, they belong
to a variety of other classes.
9.4 Verbs of Putting with a Specified Direction
References: Cowper ( 1 990b ). See also references under Dative Alternation
(sec. 2. 1 ) .
Class Members: drop, hoist, lift, lower, raise
Properties:
(25) I lifted the books.
(26) I lifted the book onto the table/out of the box.
* I lifted the book on the table.
(27) I lifted the books from the floor to the table.
(28) * Locative Alternation:
a. I lifted the books onto the table.
b. * I lifted the table with the books.
(29) * Dative Alternation:
a. I lifted the books (up) to him.
b. * I lifted him (up) the books.
Section 9.5
(30) * Middle Alternation:
a. I lifted the paperback book onto the table.
b. *Paperback books lift on'to the table easily.
(3 I) *Causative Alternations:
a. I lifted the book onto the table.
b. *The books lifted onto the table.
(32) *I lifted onto the table.
(on the interpretation where something is lifted onto the table)
(33) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a lift, a hoist
115
Comments: These verbs relate to putting an entity somewhere, typically
by moving it in a specific direction. For instance, as Cowper (I 990b) points
out, lifting does not necessarily have to be in an upward direction, although it
usually is. She proposes that what is more important is that the action involves
exerting a force against the action of gravity; this description seems to apply
to all of these verbs. Again, these verbs show a preference for onto and into
over on or in, though they are otherwise found with a wide range of locative
prepositions. They may also be found with source prepositions or with paths
describing a trajectory of motion. The verbs lift and hoist have zero-related
nominals naming instruments used to carry out the actions named by the verbs.
9.5 Pour Verbs
References: See references listed under Spray/Load Verbs below.
Class Members: dribble, drip, pour, slop, slosh, spew, spill, spurt
Properties:
(34) Tamara poured water into the bowl/over the flowers.
(35) Tamara poured water from/out of the pitcher.
(36) *Locative Alternation:
a. Tamara poured water into the bowl.
b. * Tamara poured the bowl with water.
(37) *Conative Alternation:
a. Tamara poured water into the bowl.
b. *Tamara poured at water into the bowl.
(38) *Middle Alternation:
a. Tamara poured water onto the plants.
b. * Water pours easily onto the plants.

(39)
(40)
(41)
(42)
Causative Alternation:
a. Tamara poured water onto the plants.
b. Water poured onto the plants.
*Tamara poured into the pitcher.
Coreferential interpretation of pronouns possible:
Tamarai poured the water over heri.
Zero-related Nominal (few verbs):
a spill
Section 9.6
Comments: The members of this set of verbs are often compared to
spray/load verbs like spray and squirt since they relate to putting thingstypically
liquids-on surfaces or in containers. However, these verbs are only
found in a syntactic configuration that resembles the locative variant of the
locative alternation-the alternation that is a hallmark of the spray/load verbs.
The pour verbs differ from some of the other types of verbs of putting in allowing
from phrases. Many of the members of this class participate in a causative
alternation. It is likely that this is not the causative/inchoative alternation, because
these verbs appear not to tum up in the middle construction whereas most
verbs found in the causative/inchoative alternation do.
9.6 Coil Verbs
References: See references listed under Spray/Load Verbs below.
Class Members: coil, curl, loop, roll, spin, twirl, twist, whirl, wind
Properties:
(43) Cora coiled the rope around the post.
(44) *Locative Alternation:
a. Cora coiled the rope around the post.
b. *Cora coiled the post with the rope.
(45) *Conative Alternation:
a. Cora coiled the rope around the post.
b. * Cora coiled at the rope around the post.
(46) Causativeflnchoative Alternation:
a. Cora coiled the rope around the post.
b. The rope coiled around the post.
(47) Middle Alternation:
a. Cora coiled the rope around the post.
b. That kind of rope coils easily around the post.
Section 9.7
(48) *Cora coiled around the post.
(49) Coreferential interpretation of pronouns possible:
Corai twisted the scarf around heri.
(50) Zero-related Nominal:
a coil, a twist
1 17
Comments: These verbs are often compared to the spray/load verbs, since
like the spray/load verb wrap they relate to putting something around something ·
else. However, unlike the spray/load verbs they are only found in a syntactic
configuration that resembles the locative variant of the locative alternation.
Due to their meaning, they are only found with a limited range of prepositions
heading the locative prepositional phrase; they are most often found with the
preposition around.
Coil verbs can be used as intransitive verbs of manner of motion, as well
as transitive verbs of putting; therefore, they are also included under the appropriate
subclass of verbs of motion: the intransitive roll verbs (sec. 51.3.1).
This section focuses on the properties related to their transitive use; the properties
related to their intransitive use are discussed under roll verbs. Only the
roll verbs that have transitive uses as verbs of putting are listed here; these
are primarily the subset of roll verbs that involve motion around an axis. In
addition, some coil verbs can be used as verbs of creation and transformation;
these verbs are also listed under the knead verbs (sec. 26.5).

Comments: These verbs relate to covering surfaces ana putting things into
containers. They have received considerable attention. First, the members of
·this set participate in an alternation in the expression of their arguments known
as the locative alternation. Second, these verbs show what has been called the
"holistic/partitive" effect. The direct object in the with variant-the location
argument-is associated with what has been called a "holistic" or "affected"
interpretation; that is, the location is understood to be in some sense completely
affected by the action. However, a number of studies have shown that characterizing
the i11terpretation associated with the with variant is not easy; specifically,
they have shown that the notion "holistic" is not always accurate. The subset of
Section 9.8 1 19
these verbs that take a liquid or a set of small particles as the typical direct object
in the locative variant show a slightly different set of properties from the remainder
of these verbs. For instance, they are found in the conative alternation,
and they typically allow the causative alternation in the locative variant. Some
of the spray/load verbs have zero-related nominals; typically, these nominals
receive a result interpretation. The verb vest may be inappropriately included;
it appears to participate in the locative alternation, but unlike the other verbs in
this set, its locatum argument is usually an abstract noun phrase.
9.8 Fill Verbs
References: B. Levin and Rappaport (1988), Rappaport Hovav and B. Levin
(1992). See also references listed under Spray/Load Verbs above.
Class Members: adorn, anoint, bandage, bathe, bestrew, bind, blanket, block,
blot, bombard, carpet, choke, cloak, clog, clutter, coat, contaminate, cover,
dam, dapple, deck, decorate, deluge, dirty, douse, dot, drench, edge, embellish,

(62) With alternates with in (some verbs):
a. Leigh swaddled the baby with blankets.
Leigh swaddled the baby in blankets.
b. Leslie staffed the store with employees.
* Leslie staffed the store in employees.
1 20 Section 9.9
Comments: These verbs appear similar to the spray/load verbs in meaning,
but unlike them they are only found in what looks like the with variant of the
locative alternation. The direct object of these verbs is also said to receive the
"holistic" interpretation found in the with variant of the locative alternation.
When the argument that is the object of with-the locatum-is expressed as
the subject, the sentence can be understood as describing a state (Jackendoff
(1990b)). These verbs typically describe the resulting state of a location as a
consequence of putting something on it or in it; thus they differ from the pour
verbs, which describe the manner in which the putting is done. Some of these
verbs, particularly if they involve covering with clothes or cloths, allow with to
alternate with in; these verbs include: bathe, blanket, coat, cloak, cover, deck,
festoon, garland, line, robe, shroud, swaddle, swathe, veil, wreathe.
9.9 Butter Verbs
References: Bladin (1911), Buck (1993), Carter (1976, 1988), E.V. Clark

121
Comments: These verbs all have zero-related nominals; their meaning can
be paraphrased as "put X on/in (something)," where X is the noun that the verb
takes its name from. These verbs appear similar to the spray/load verbs and
the fill verbs in meaning; specifically, the object of these verbs also receives the
"holistic" interpretation found in the with variant of the locative alternation. A
cognate with phrase may be found with these verbs; the object of with is an NP
headed by the noun that the verb derives its name from, or a noun that bears the
hyponym relation to the noun that the verb derives its name from. Such with
phrases are typically most acceptable if they contribute additional information
about the thing that is being put somewhere through the use of a modifier of
some kind. The process of forming verbs of this type is highly productive, so
that this class is likely to grow in size. See also Verbs of Coloring (sec. 24) for
some other verbs that show similar behavior.
9.10 Pocket Verbs
References: Bladin (1911), Carter (1976, 1988), E.V. Clark and H.H. Clark
(1979), Dixon (1991), Duszak (1980), Hale and Keyser (1991, 1992), Jackendoff
(1990b), Jespersen (1942), Leitner (1974), Marchand (1969, 1974),
Rappaport and B. Levin (1985), Sehnert and Sharwood-Smith (1973)

Properties:
(68) Lydia pocketed the change.
(i.e., Lydia put the change in her pocket.)
(69) *Cognate Location Phrase:
* Lydia pocketed the change in her pocket.
?? Lydia pocketed the change in her left front jacket pocket.
(70) * Locative Alternation:
a. *Lydia pocketed the change in her pocket.
b. * Lydia pocketed her pocket with the change.
122 Section 10
(71) *Causative Alternations:
a. Lydia pocketed the change.
b. *The change pocketed.
Comments: These verbs all have zero-related nominals; the related nouns
refer to a location where things can be put. The meaning of these verbs can
be paraphrased as "put (something) on/in X," where X is the noun that the
verb takes its name from.· Most of these verbs do not seem to easily allow
cognate locative phrases. This set of verbs is much smaller than the set of
butter verbs (cf. above). Nevertheless, the process of forming verbs of this type
is productive, so that this class is likely to grow in size.

b. *The smudges removed from the tabletop.
123
Comments: These verbs relate to the removal of an entity from a location.
One of their arguments is expressed in a prepositional phrase headed by the
preposition from. Most of these verbs-with the exception of some, such as
t;xcommunicate, which only take animate objects-can also take from followed
by one of a variety of locative prepositions. Most of these verbs cannot take the
prepositions out of or off of, even though these prepositions can head source
phrases elsewhere. Each of these verbs imposes particular restrictions on the
set of possible direct objects; some only take human objects. Most of these
verbs do not have zero-related nominals.
10.2 Banish Verbs
Class Members: banish, deport, evacuate, expel, extradite, recall, remove
Properties:
(79) The king banished the general from the army.
(80) The king banished the general to a mountain fortress.
(8 1 ) *The king banished the general from the palace to a mountain fortress.
(82) *Locative Alternation:
a. The king banished the general from the !!TIDY.
b. *The king banished the army of the general.
(83) *Conative Alternation:
a. The king banished the general from the army.
b. *The king banished at the general from the army.
(84) *Causative Alternations:
a. The king banished the general from the army.
b. * The general banished from the army.
Comments: These verbs relate to the removal of an entity, typically a person,
from a location. The location argument is expressed in a prepositional phrase
headed by the preposition from. These verbs do not allow any of the other
prepositions that can head source phrases, such as out, off, or a combination
of from and another preposition. Unlike the remove verbs, these verbs allow
to phrases as well as from phrases, though not simultaneously. Most of these
verbs do not have zero-related nominals.

a clear road
the road is clear of debris
(93) Adjectival Passive Participle:
a cleared table
Comments: Although these verbs appear to relate to the removal of a substance
from a location, in at least some of their uses they are better characterized
as verbs of change of state (cf. sec. 45); like verbs of change of state, most
of them show the causative/inchoative alrernation. The state that each of these
Section 1 0.4.1 125
verbs lexicalizes is a state that can hold of a "location" as a result of removing
something from that location. Like some other verbs of change of state, certain
verbs in this class are zero-related to adjectives. These verbs participate in both
a transitive and an intransitive form of the locative alternation, although they
take the preposition of where the spray/load verbs (sec. 9.7) and swarm verbs
(sec. 47.5. 1 ) take with (the of phrase is more awkward in the intransitive form of
the locative alternation). The verbs in this class takeft'om in the locative variant
when they are used to refer to possessional deprivation, but may take a variety
of locative prepositions when the verb describes the removal of an entity from
a location. In the of variant, the object of the verb-the location argumentreceives
the "holistic" interpretation also exhibited by the spray/load verbs in
the with variant. Most of these verbs do not have zero-related nominals.

also references listed under Spray/Load Verbs (sec. 9.7).
10.4.1 Manner Subclass
Class Members: bail, buff, dab, distill, dust, erase, expunge, flush, leach,
lick, pluck, polish, prune, purge, rinse, rub, scour, scrape, scratch, scrub, shave,
skim, smooth, soak, squeeze, strain, strip, suck, suction, swab, sweep, trim,
wash, wear, weed, whisk, winnow, wipe, V�ring
Properties:
(94) a. Brian wiped the fingerprints from the counter.
b. Brian wiped the fingerprints from inside/outside/under the
cupboard.
(95) Locative Alternation:
a. Brian wiped the fingerprints from the counter.
b. Brian wiped the counter (*of fingerprints).
(96) Conative Alternation (some verbs):
a. Brian wiped the counter.
Brian wiped at the counter.
b. Paula trimmed the bush.
* Paula trimmed at the bush.
(97) * Causative Alternations:
a. Brian wiped the fingerprints from the counter.
* The fingerprints wiped from the counter.

b. Brian wiped the counter.
* The counter wiped.

a. Brian was wiping the counter.
b. Brian was wiping.
Section 10.4.1
(99) Unspecified Object Alternation plus Locative PP (some verbs):
a. Brian was wiping the wall behind the stove.
b. Brian was wiping behind the stove.
( 100) Resultative Phrase:
Brian wiped the counter clean (of fingerprints).
( 1 0 1 ) Zero-related Nominal:
a wipe (*of the fingerprints/the counter)
give a wipe (some verbs)
Comments: These verbs also relate to removing things from surfaces or
containers. Like the clear verbs above, they participate in a form of the locative
alternation and show the "holistic/partitive" effect. When the location is the
direct object, it receives the "holistic" interpretation, also found when the
location argument of a clear verb is the direct object. However, while the
chwr verbs lexicalize a state that can result from removing something from a
location, these verbs lexicalize a manner or means of removal. They also differ
from the clear verbs in typically not allowing an of phrase when the location is
expressed as the direct object. The of phrase may appear as a complement of an
adjective heading a resultative phrase when the location is the direct object; see
the resultative construction use above. Occasionally, these verbs are found with
a bare of phrase, but only if the manner or means meaning component is lost
or at least less salient (B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 99 1 )). Most members
of this class have a zero-related nominal that refers to the action named by the
verb.
Most of these verbs in their basic meanings are probably not verbs of removing,
though they can be used as verbs of removing. Since some of the manners
or means that are part of the meanings of these verbs are specifically associated
with removing things from surfaces or containers, these verbs show properties
of verbs of removing. But some manners or means may be associated with
putting things on surfaces or in containers as well as with removing things
from surfaces or containers, and the verbs whose meaning involves these (e.g.
wipe) can be used both as verbs of putting (e.g. wipe the crumbs onto the floor)
and as verbs of removing; these verbs are cross-listed (sec. 9).
Section 10.4.2 127
10.4.2 Instrument Subclass
Class Members: brush, comb, file, filter, hoover, hose, iron, mop, plow, rake,
sandpaper, shear, shovel, siphon, sponge, towel, vacuum
Properties:
( 1 02) a. Carla shoveled the snow from the walk.
b. Carla shoveled the snow from under/near/among the bushes.
( 103) Locative Alternation:
a. Carla shoveled the snow from the walk.
b. Carla shoveled the walk (*of snow).
( 1 04) * Conative Alternation:
a. Carla shoveled the walk.
b. * Carla shoveled at the walk.
( 1 05) * Causative Alternations:

* The snow shoveled from the walk.
b. Carla shoveled the walk.
* The walk shoveled.
( 1 06) Unspecified Object Alternation (some verbs):
a. Carla was shoveling the walk.
b. Carla was shoveling.
( 1 07) Unspecified Object plus Locative PP (some verbs):
a. Carla mopped the floor under the furniture.
b. Carla mopped under the furniture.
( 1 08) Resultative Phrase:
Carla shoveled the walk clean (of snow).
( 1 09) Zero-related Nominal:
a shovel
* a shovel of the snow/the walk
Comments: These verbs pattern exactly like the manner subclass of the wipe
verbs, except that they are all zero-related to a noun that is the name of an
instrument. These verbs in their most basic meaning probably refer to1 using
the instrument they take their name from in a conventional way. Since many
of these instruments are used for removing things from surfaces or containers,
they show properties of verbs of removing. But some of these instruments
may be used either to put things on surfaces or in containers or to remove
things from surfaces or containers, and the verbs taking their names from such
128 Section 10.5
instruments can be used either as verbs of putting (e.g., shovel the dirt into the
jlowerbed, rake the fertilizer into the field) or as verbs of removing; these verbs
are cross-listed (sec. 9). None of the verbs in this subclass have zero-related
result or action nominals.
These verbs, like the clear verbs above, participate in a form of the locative
alternation and show the "holistic/partitive" effect. When the location is the
direct object, it receives the "holistic" interpretation, also found when the
location argument of a clear verb is the direct object. These verbs differ from
the clear verbs in typically not allowing an of phrase when the location is
expressed as the direct object. The of phrase may appear as a complement of
an adjective heading a resultative phrase when the location is the direct object;
see the resultative construction use above. These verbs are found with an of
phrase even less often than the verbs in the manner subclass of the wipe verbs;
again, an of phrase occurs only if the instrument meaning component is lost or
at least less salient (B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 99 1 )).
10.5 Verbs of Possessional Deprivation: Steal Verbs
References: Dixon ( 1 989), Fillmore ( 1 968b), Norvig and G. Lakoff ( 1 987),
Snell-Hornby ( 1 983)
Class Members: abduct, cadge, capture, confiscate, cop, emancipate, embezzle,
exorcise, extort, extract, filch, flog, grab, impound, kidnap, liberate, lift,
nab, pilfer, pinch, pirate, plagiarize, purloin, recover, redeem, reclaim, regain,
n·possess, rescue, retrieve, rustle, seize, smuggle, snatch, sneak, sponge, steal,
swipe, take, thieve, wangle, weasel, winkle, withdraw, wrest
Properties:
( 1 1 0) The thief stole the painting from the museum.
(Il l ) * Locative Alternation:
a. The thief stole the painting from the museum.
b. * The thief stole the museum of the painting.
( 1 12) * Benefactive Alternation:
a. The thief stole the painting for Mr. Smith.
b. * The thief stole Mr. Smith the painting.
( 1 1 3 ) * Conative Alternation:
a. The thief stole the painting from the museum.
b. * The thief stole at the painting from the museum.
( 1 1 4) * Causative Alternations:
a. The thief stole the painting from the museum.
b. * The painting stole from the museum.
Section 10.6 129
Comments: These verbs primarily describe the removal of something from
someone 's possession; the previous possessor or a location associated with this
possessor is expressed in a from prepositional phrase. These verbs can also
take benefactive for phrases to indicate the person on whose behalf the removal
was done, but they do not participate in the benefactive alternation. Although
they are found in a syntactic frame that resembles the location variant of the
locative alternation, they do not participate in the locative alternation either.
Some of these verbs can also be used as verbs of obtaining and are cross-listed
(sec. 1 3.5); this possibility probably arises because in many situations in which
someone obtains something, someone else loses possession of that thing.
10.6 Verbs of Possessional Deprivation: Cheat Verbs
References: Dixon ( 1 989), Fillmore ( 1 968b), Hook ( 1 983), Jackendoff
( 1 990b), Kayne ( 1984), B . Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 99 1 ). See also
references listed under Clear Verbs above.
Class Members: absolve, acquit, balk, bereave, bilk, bleed, break (of a habit),
burgle, cheat, cleanse, con, cull, cure, defraud, denude, deplete, depopulate,
deprive, despoil, disabuse, disarm, disencumber, dispossess, divest, drain, ease,
exonerate, fleece, free, gull, milk, mulct, pardon, plunder, purge, purify, ransack,
relieve, render, rid, rifle, rob, sap, strip, swindle, unburden, void, wean
Properties:
( 1 1 5) The doctor cured Pat of pneumonia.
( 1 1 6) * Locative Alternation:
a. * The doctor cured pneumonia from Pat.
b. The doctor cured Pat of pneumonia.
( 1 1 7) * Causative Alternations:
a. The doctor cured Pat of pneumonia.
b. * Pat cured of pneumonia.
( 1 1 8) Of alternates with out (of) with a few verbs:
a. The swindler cheated Pat of her fortune.
The swindler cheated Pat out of her fortune.
b. The doctor cured Pat of pneumonia.
* The doctor cured Pat out of pneumonia.
Comments: Like the steal verbs, these verbs can be characterized as
verbs of possessional deprivation. They typically describe depriving someone/
something of an inalienable possession (in a broad sense). These verbs
have attracted interest because they tum up in one of the two syntactic frames
shown by the form of the locative alternation associated with the clear verbs
1 30 Section 10.7
(cf. above). The direct object of these verbs is said to receive the "holistic"
interpretation found in the of variant of the locative alternation as manifested
by the clear verbs. A few of these verbs allow the preposition of to alternate
with out of (e.g., cheat (out) of a reward).
10.7 Pit Verbs
References: Andrews (1986), Bladin ( 19 1 1), E.V. Clark and H.H. Clark
( 1979), Dowty ( 1979), Duszak ( 1980), Hook ( 1 983), Hom ( 1988), Jackendoff

( 1969, 1973, 1974), Rose ( 1973), A.S.C. Ross ( 1976)
Class Members: bark, beard, bone, burl, core, gill, gut, head, hull, husk, lint,
louse, milk, peel, pinion, pip, pit, pith, pod, poll, pulp, rind, scale, scalp, seed,
shell, 􀐒huck, skin, snail, stalk, stem, stone, string, tail, tassel, top, vein, weed,
wind, worm, zest
Properties:
( 1 19) The cook boned the fish.
(i.e., The cook removed the bones from the fish.)
( 1 20) * Cognate Of Phrase:
* The cook boned the fish of bones.
* The cook boned the fish of its backbone.
( 1 2 1 ) * Causative Alternations:
a. The cook boned the fish.
b. * The fish boned.
Comments: These verbs all have zero-related nominals. The meaning of each
of them could be paraphrased as "remove X from (something)," where X is the
noun zero-related to the verb. The nouns that these verbs are based on might·
for the most part be considered to be an inalienably possessed part of an animal
or plant. The direct object of these verbs receives the "holistic" interpretation
associated with the with/of variant of the locative alternation: if a cook bones a
fish, all of the bones are understood to have been removed. These verbs do not
allow a cognate of phrase. The process of forming such verbs from nouns does
not seem to be particularly productive, but this may reflect the limited number
of nouns of the appropriate type that these verbs can be related to.
10.8 D ebone Verbs
References: Andrews ( 1 986), Bladin ( 1 9 1 1), E.V. Clark and H.H. Clark

Section 10.9 131
Class Members: deaccent, debark, debone, deb6wel, debug, debur, declaw,
defang, defat, defeather, deflea, deflesh, defoam, defog, deforest, defrost, defuzz,
degas, degerm, deglaze, degrease, degrit, degum, degut, dehair, dehead,
dehorn, dehull, dehusk, deice, deink, delint, delouse, deluster, demast, derat, derib,
derind, desalt, descale, desex, desprout, destarch, des tress, detassel, detusk,
devein, dewater, dewax, deworm
Properties:
( 1 22) The cook deboned the fish.
(i.e., The cook removed the bones from the fish.)
( 1 23) * Cognate Of Phrase:
* The cook de boned the fish of all its bones.
( 1 24) * Causative Alternations:
a. The cook deboned the fish.
b. * The fish deboned.
Comments: These verbs all have related nominals; morphologically, each
verb is formed by the prefix de- plus this nominal. The meaning of these verbs
could be paraphrased as "remove X from (something)," where X is the noun
related to the verb. The nouns that these verbs are based on might for the most
part be considered to be an inalienably possessed part of an animal or plant
(sometimes in a broad sense of inalienable possession). Those verbs that are not
formed from nouns meeting this criterion (e.g. , debug, debur, delouse, deworm)
generally do not permit the prefix de- to drop, contrasting with those verbs that
are, which allow the prefix de- to drop while maintaining the same meaning.
Thus there is an overlap between this set of verbs and the pit verbs above.
The direct object of these verbs receives the "holistic" interpretation associated
with the with/of variant of the locative alternation: if a cook debones a fish, all
of the bones are understood to have been removed. These verbs do not allow a
cognate of phrase. They seem to be slightly more productively coined than the
pit verbs.
10.9 Mine Verbs
References: E. V. Clark and H.H. Chirk ( 1 979), Karius ( 1 985), Lehrer (1 990),
Leitner ( 1 974)
Class Members: mine, quarry
Properties:
( 1 25) The men mined the gold.
(i.e., The men removed the gold from the mine.)
132 Section 1 1
( 1 26) Cognate Source Phrase:
The men were able to mine more gold from the abandoned mine.
( 1 27) * Causative Alternations:
a. The men mined the gold.
b. * The gold mined.
Comments: These verbs all have zero-related nominals; the nouns name
locations that one typically removes something from. The meaning of each of
these verbs could be paraphrased as "remove (something) from X," where X
is the noun zero-related to the verb. A cognate source phrase may be found
with these verbs if it expresses further information about the source. There
are hardly any verbs bearing this type of relation to a noun and the process of
coining such verbs does not seem to be productive; this may reflect the paucity
of appropriate nouns for these verbs to be related to.
11 Verbs of Sending and Carrying
References: Dixon ( 1 99 1 ), Green ( 1 974), Gropen et al. ( 1 989), Gruber ( l 965 ,
1976), Ikegami ( 1 970), Oehrle ( 1 976), Pinker ( 1 989)
11.1 Send Verbs
Class Members: airmail, convey, deliver, dispatch, express, FedEx, forward,
hand, mail, pass, port, post, return, send, shift, ship, shunt, slip, smuggle, sneak,
transfer, transport, UPS
Properties:
( 1 28) Nora sent the book (from Paris) (to London).
( 1 29) Dative Alternation (some verbs):
a. Nora sent the book to Peter.
b. Nora sent Peter the book.
( 1 30) * Conative Alternation:
a. Nora sent the book to Peter.
b. * Nora sent at the book to Peter.
( 1 3 1 ) * Causative Alternations:
a. Nora sent the book to Peter.
b. * The book sent to Peter.
Section 11.2
( 1 32) * Middle Alternation:
a. Nora sent books to children.
b. * Books send easily to children.
( 1 33) Coreferential interpretation of pronouns not possible:
* Norai sent the book with heri.
(cf. Norai brought the book with heri.)
133
Comments: These verbs relate to causing an entity to change location. The
entity moves unaccompanied by the agent (compare the verbs bring and carry)
and, as Pinker ( 1 989) writes, the motion is "mediated by a separation in time and
space, sometimes bridged by a particular means of transfer" (p. 1 1 0). These
verbs differ from verbs of putting (sec. 9) in allowing the goal preposition
to. Some, but not all, send verbs can take a from phrase indicating a source.
For some of these verbs, the change in location can also result in transfer of
possession, as attested by their ability to show the dative alternation, but they
are not cross-listed under verbs of change of possession (sec. 1 3). The inability
of some of these verbs to show the dative alternation might be attributed to the
so-called Latinate restriction on the double object construction (see sec. 2. 1 ,
Dative Alternation).
11.2 Slide Verbs
Class Members: bounce, float, move, roll, slide
Properties:
( 1 34) Carla slid the books across the table.
( 1 35) Carla slid the books from one end of the table to the other.
( 1 36) Dative Alternation (except move):
a. Carla slid the book to Dale.
b. Carla slid Dale the book.
( 1 37) * Conative Alternation:
a. Carla slid the book (to Dale).
b. * Carla slid at the book (to Dale).
(cf. Nora pushed at the rock.)
( 1 38) Causative/lnchoative Alternation:
a. Carla slid the books across the table.
b. The books slid across the table.
( 1 39) Middle Alternation:
a. Carla slid those books across the table.
b. Those books slide across the table easily.
134 Section 1 1 .3
(140) Acceptability of coreferential interpretation varies:
a. ? Carlai slid the book away from heri .
b. * Carlai bounced the ball with heri.
Comments: These verbs can be used as intransitive verbs of manner of
motion, as well as transitive verbs of causing a change of position; therefore,
they are also included under the appropriate subclass of verbs of motion: the
intransitive roll verbs (sec. 51.3.1). This section focuses on the properties
related to their transitive use; the properties related to their intransitive use are
discussed under Roll Verbs. Not all the intransitive roll verbs are listed here,
because not all of them have transitive uses as verbs of sending and carrying; in
particular, most of the roll verbs that involve motion around an axis do not show
such transitive uses. With the exception of move, the verbs in this subsection
can also be used as verbs of change of possession brought about by a change
of position, as shown by their ability to show the dative alternation, but they
are not cross-listed under verbs of change of possession (sec. 13). The agent
simply brings about the change of location described by the verb, but does not
accompany the moving entity.
11.3 Bring and Take
Class Members: bring, take (only)
Properties:
(141) Nora brought the book to the meeting.
(142) Nora brought the book to Pamela.
(143) Nora brought the book from horne.
(144) Dative Alternation:
a. Nora brought the book to Pamela.
b. Nora brought Pamela the book.
(145) * Conative Alternation:
a. Nora brought the book to the meeting.
b. * Nora brought at the book to the meeting.
(146) * Causative Alternations:
a. Nora brought the book to the meeting.
b. * The book brought to the meeting.
(147) * Middle Alternation:
a. Nora brought the book to the meeting.
b. * The book brings easily to the meeting.
Section 1 1 .4 1 35
(148) * Resultative Phrase:
* Nora brought Pamela breathless.
(on the interpretation where the bringing makes Pamela breathless)
( 149) Coreferential interpretation of pronouns possible:
Norai brought the book with heri.
Comments: These verbs have been described as "verbs of continuous causation
of accompanied motion in a deictically-specified direction" (Gropen et
al. (1989)). Although these verbs are not used intransitively, they have been
considered the "causative" counterparts of come and go. These two verbs are
set apart from other verbs of sending and carrying by the presence of the deictic
component of meaning and the Jack of a meaning component that specifies the
manner in which the motion is brought about. These verbs can also be used as
verbs of change of possession brought about by a change of position, as shown
by their ability to show the dative alternation, but they are not cross-listed under
verbs of change of possession (sec. 1 3).
11.4 Carry Verbs
Class Members: carry, drag, haul, heave, heft, hoist, kick, Jug, pull, push,
schlep, shove, tote, tow, tug
Properties:
(150) Amanda carried the package (from Boston) (to New York).
(151) Dative Alternation:
a. Amanda carried the package to Pamela.
b. ? Amanda carried Pamela the package.
(152) * Conative Alternation:
a. Amanda carried the package (to New York).
b. * Amanda carried at the package (to New York).
(cf. Nora pushed at/against the chair.)
( 1 53) * Causative Alternations:
a. Amanda carried the package (to New York).
b. * The package carried (to New York).
(154) * Middle Alternation:
a. Amanda carried packages (to New York).
b. * Packages carry easily (to New York).
( 1 55) Acceptability of coreferential interpretation varies:
a. Amandai 􀐓arried the package with heri.
b. Amandai lugged the books to the store with heri .
1 36 Section 1 1.5
Comments: These verbs relate to the causation of accompanied motion. None
of them lexicalize a particular direction of motion. Instead, the members of this
class differ from each other in meaning with respect to the manner/means of
motion. The direction of motion must be overtly specified in a prepositional
phrase. In fact, many of these verbs (e.g., pull, push) are also verbs of exerting
force and are cross-listed (sec. 1 2). Such verbs allow conative at when used
as verbs of exerting force, but when they are used as verbs of causation of
accompanied motion (as shown by their use with a goal or directional phrase),
they do not take an at phrase : *Amanda pushed at the chair to the wall.
Although these verbs are listed as allowing the dative alternation, opinions
vary as to whether the verbs in this class do manifest this alternation. It is clear
that some of them are more acceptable in the double object construction than
others.
11.5 Drive Verbs
References: Karius ( 1 985), Leitner ( 1 974), Marchand ( 1 969, 1 974)
Class Members: barge, bus, cart, drive , ferry, fly, row, shuttle, truck, wheel,
wire (money)
Properties:
( 1 56) Amanda drove the package (from Boston) (to New York).
( 1 57) ? Dative Alternation (some verbs):
a. Amanda drove the package to Pamela.
b. ? Amanda drove Pamela the package.
( 1 58) * Conative Alternation:
a. Amanda drove the package (to New York).
b. * Amanda drove at the package (to New York).
( 1 59) * Causative Alternations:
a. Amanda drove the package (to New York).
b. * The package drove (to New York).
( 1 60) * Middle Alternation:
a. Amanda drove packages (to New York).
b. * Packages drive easily (to New York).
( 1 6 1 ) Coreferential interpretation o f pronouns not possible:
* Amandai drove the package with heri.
Comments: These verbs describe the causation of accompanied motion; they
inherently specify something about the manner of motion, typically the vehicle
or means used, and some of them even take their name from the vehicle used.
Section 12 137
The direction of motion is specified by directional phrases and is not part of
the meaning of these verbs. Opinions vary as to whether these verbs manifest
the dative alternation. It appears that some of them are more acceptable in the
double object construction than others; the dative alternation seems to be least
acceptable with those verbs which are zero-related to nouns, particularly nouns
that are vehicle names.
12 Verbs of Exerting Force: Push/Pull Verbs
References: Dixon ( 1 99 1 )
Class Members: ?draw, heave, jerk, press, pull, push, shove, ?thrust, tug,
yank
Properties:
( 1 62) Nora pushed the chair.
( 1 63) Conative Alternation:
a. Nora pushed the chair.
b. Nora pushed at/mi/against the chair.
( 1 64) *Causative Alternations:
a. Nora pushed the chair.
b. * The chair pushed.
( 1 65) Way Object Alternation (some verbs):
a. Nora pushed through the crowd.
b. Nora pushed her way through the crowd.
( 1 66) Nora pushed the chair against the wall.
( 1 67) Coreferential interpretation of pronouns possible:
Norai pushed the chair away from heri.
( 1 68) Resultative Phrase:
Nora pushed the door shut.
( 169) Zero-related Nominal:
a push (*of the chair)
give the chair a push.
Comments: These verbs relate to the exertion of a force on an entity. They
differ from each other in meaning with respect to the type of force exerted.
138 Section 13
Some of these verbs can also be used as carry verbs-verbs of causation of
accompanied motion in some manner-and have been cross-listed (sec. 11.4 ),
together with the properties attributable to membership in this other class.
13 Ve rbs of Change of Possession
References: Abraham (1983), Croft (1985 , 1991), Dixon (1973, 1989, 1991),
Fillmore (1977b), lkegami (1973), Jackendoff (1992b). See also references
under Dative Alternation (sec. 2.1).
13.1 Give Ve rbs
Class Members: fe ed, give, lease, lend, loan, pass, pay, peddle, refund,
render, rent, repay, sell, serve, trade
Properties:
( 170) They lent a bicycle to me.
( 171) * They lent a bicycle near me/behind me.
(172) Dative Alternation:
a. They lent a bicycle to me.
b. They lent me a bicycle. ·
( 173) *Fulfilling Alternation:
a. They lent a bicycle to me.
b. * They lent me with a bicycle.
(174) *Causative Alternations:
a. They lent a bicycle to me.
b. *A bicycle lent (to me).
Comments: These verbs of change of possession display the dative alternation,
though there may be some differences of opinion concerning whether
some of these verbs actually are fo und in the double object construction. Although
the prepositional phrase is optional with some of these verbs, when it
does appear, it must be headed by the preposition to.
13.2 Contribute Verbs
Class Members: administer, contribute, disburse, distribute, donate, extend,
forfeit, proffer, refer, reimburse, relinquish, remit, restore, return, sacrifice,
submit, surrender, transfer
Section 13.3
Properties:
( 1 75) We contributed our paycheck to her.
( 1 76) * We contributed our paycheck on the counter/under the papers.
( 1 77) * Dative Alternation:
a. We contributed our paycheck to her.
b. * We contributed her our paycheck.
( 1 78) * Fulfilling Alternation:
a. We contributed our paycheck to her.
b. * We contributed her with our paycheck.
( 1 79) * Causative Alternations:
a. We contributed our paycheck to her.
b. * Our paycheck contributed (to her).

· Comments: These verbs of change of possession do not allow the dative
alternation. Their failure to be found in the double object construction has often
been attributed to their Latinate character (see sec. 2. 1 , Dative Alternation). Like
the alternating verbs of change of possession, these verbs are characterized by
taking a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition to.
13.3 Verbs of Future Having
Class Members: advance, allocate, allot, assign, award, bequeath, cede,
concede, extend, grant, guarantee, issue, leave, offer, owe, promise, vote, will ,
yield
Properties:
( 1 80) We offered a job to her.
( 1 81 ) * We offered a job behind her.
( 1 82) Dative Alternation:
a. We offered a job to her.
b. We offered her a job.
( 1 83) * Fulfilling Alternation:
a. We offered a job to her. ·
b. * We offered her with a job.
( 1 84) * Causative Alternations:
a. We offered a job to her.
b. * A job offered (to her).
Comments: These verbs relate to a change of possession that will take place
in the future. They all participate in the dative alternation. As J. McCawley
140 Section 1 3 .4
(personal communication) has pointed out, some of these verbs can take sentential
complements that can be related to the object of the verb in its transitive
use: offer him a job can be paraphrased as offer to give him a job. Although the
prepositional phrase is optional with some of these verbs, when it does appear,
it must be headed by the preposition to. These verbs do not differ from the give
verbs above in the properties they show, so that this class and the give class
could be collapsed; however, they have been kept distinct here following the
precedent in some work on the dative alternation.
13.4 Verbs of Providing
13.4.1 Verbs of Fulfilling
References: B lansitt ( 1 984), Channon ( 1 982), Croft ( 1 986, 1 99 1 ), Emonds

( 1 992), Pinker ( 1 989), Rappaport and B. Levin ( 1 985)
Class Members: credit, entrust, furnish, issue, leave, present, provide, serve,
supply, trust
Properties:
( 1 85) Brown presented a plaque to Jones.
( 1 86) * Brown presented a plaque onto the table/next to the lectern.
( 1 87) Fulfilling Alternation:
a. Brown presented a plaque to Jones.
b. Brown presented Jones with a plaque.
( 1 88) * Brown presented a plaque near/next to/at Jones.
( 1 89) the presentation of a plaque (to Jones)
the presentation to/*of Jones (*with a plaque)
Comments: These verbs are described by Gropen et al. ( 1 989) as verbs
where "X gives something to Y that Y deserves, needs, or is worthy of."
Besides expressing their arguments in the ' NP l V NP2 to NP3 ' pattern typical
of verbs of change of possession, these verbs also show a second pattern
involving a with phrase, 'NP I V NP3 with NP2 ' . In the first pattern, the goal
argument is expressed in the prepositional phrase; in the second pattern, the
theme argument is expressed in the prepositional phrase. These verbs do not
show alternative prepositions; to, for instance, cannot alternate with locative
prepositions. Judgments differ as to whether some of these verbs can be found
Section 1 3.5. 1 141
in the dative alternation. This property is not indicated here; rather any verb
that clearly demonstrates this property is also included in a class of verbs in this
section whose members do show the'dative alternation--either the give verbs
or the verbs of future having.
13.4.2 Equip Verbs
Class Members: arm, burden, charge (with a task), compensate, equip, invest ,
ply, regale, reward, saddle
Properties:
( 1 90) Brown equipped Jones with a camera.
( 1 9 1 ) * Brown equipped a camera near/next to/at Jones.
( 1 92) * Fulfilling Alternation:
a. * Brown equipped a camera to Jones.
b. Brown equipped Jones with a camera.
( 1 93) * Dative Alternation:
a. * Brown equipped a camera to Jones.
b. * Brown equipped Jones a camera.
Comments: These verbs are rather close in meaning to the verbs of fulfi l l ing,
but their meaning seems to specify something about what is provided rather
than about the actual type of act of providing. These verbs differ from the verbs
of fulfilling in only showing one of the var.iants of the fulfilling alternation : the
variant involving the with phrase. None of these verbs participates in the dative
alternation; presumably this property is related at least in part to the fact that
they are not found in the 'NP V NP to NP' frame.
13.5 Verbs of Obtaining
References: Channon ( 1 982), Croft ( 1 985), Fillmore ( 1 977b), Ikegami
( 1 973), Jackendoff ( 1 992c), Kimball ( 1 973a). See also references listed under
Dative Alternation (sec. 2. 1).
13.5.1 Get Verbs
Class Members: book, buy, call, cash, catch, charter, ?choose, earn, fetch,
find, gain, gather, get, hire, keep, lease, leave, order, phone (doctor), pick (fruit,
flower), pluck (flower), procure, pull (a beer), reach, rent, reserve, save, secure,
shoot (game), slaughter (animal), steal, vote, win
Properties:
( 1 94) Carmen bought a dress (at Bloomingdale 's).
142
(195)
( 1 96)
( 1 97)
( 1 98)
( 1 99)
Most verbs allow a from phrase :
Carmen bought a dress from Diana.
Benefactive Alternation:
a. Carmen bought a dress for Mary.
b. Carmen bought Mary a dress.
* Dative Alternation:
a. * Carmen bought a dress to Mary.
b. Carmen bought Mary a dress.
* Locative Alternation:
a. Carmen bought a dress from Diana.
b. * Carmen bought Diana of a dress.
Sum of Money Subject Alternation (some verbs):
a. Carmen bought a dress at Bloomingdale 's for $50.
b. $50 won't even buy a dress at B loomingdale 's.
Section 13.5.2
Comments: The members of this subset of the verbs of obtaining participate
in the benefactive alternation. They take a benefactive argument that can be
expressed either as the first object in the double object construction or in a
for prepositional phrase. Some verbs in this class are verbs of obtaining in
their basic sense; others, such as shoot, are members of other classes in their
basic meaning, but show an extended meaning as verbs of obtaining. Some
of these verbs can also be used as steal verbs and are cross-listed (sec. 1 0.5);
this possibility probably arises because in many situations in which someone
obtains something someone else loses possession of that thing. Some of the get
verbs
.
can take a sum of money as their subject;
·
this is only the case for those
verbs where the process of obtaining involves a transfer of money.
13.5.2 Obtain Verbs
Class Members: accept, accumulate, acquire, appropriate, borrow, ?cadge,
collect, exact, grab, inherit, obtain, purchase, receive, recover, regain, retrieve,
seize, select, snatch
Properties:
(200) Carmen obtained the spare part (at the hardware store).
(20 1 ) Most verbs allow afrom phrase :
Carmen obtained the spare part from Diana.
(202) * Benefactive Alternation:
a. Carmen obtained a spare part for Mary.
b. * Carmen obtained Mary a spare part.
Section 1 3.6
(203) * Dative Alternation:
a. * Carmen obtained a spare part to Mary.
b. * Carmen obtained Mary a spare part.
(204) * Locative Alternation:
a. Carmen obtained a spare part from Diana.
b. * Carmen obtained Diana of a spare part.
(205) Sum of Money Subject Alternation (a few verbs):
a. Carmen purchased a dress at Bloomingdale's for $50.
b. $50 won 't even purchase a dress at Bloomingdale 's.
1 43
Comments: Like the get verbs, these verbs can take a benefactive/or prepositional
phrase, but unlike the get verbs, they do not show the benefactive
alternation. With a few exceptions, the inability to be fou.nd in the double
object construction could be attributed to the Latinate character of the obtain
verbs (see sec. 2. 1 , Dative Alternation). Some of these verbs can also be used
as steal verbs and are cross-listed (sec. I 0.5); this possibility probably arises
because in many situations in which someone obtains something someone else
loses possession of that thing. A few of the obtain verbs can take a sum of
money as their subject; this is the case for those verbs where the process of
obtaining involves a transfer of money.
The verbs aqcept, inherit, and receive have been included here since they
pattern like the other obtain verbs with respect to the listed properties (except
that inherit does not take a benefactive prepositional phrase, since one cannot
inherit something on someone else's behalf). However, the subject of these three
verbs is understood to play a more "passive" part in the process of obtaining
than the subject of the other obtain verbs.
13.6 Verbs of Exchange
References: Croft ( 1 99 1 )
Class Members: barter, change, exchange, substitute, swap, trade
Properties:
(206) Gwen exchanged the dress for a shirt.
(207) * Dative Alternation:
a. * Gwen exchanged the dress to Mary.
b. * Gwen exchanged Mary the dress.
(208) * Benefactive Alternation:
a. Gwen exchanged the dress for Mary. (some verbs)
b. * Gwen exchanged Mary the dress.
144 Section 13.7
Comments: These verbs relate to exchanging one thing for another. They are
not found with to phrases expressing goals, nor with from phrases expressing
sources. Some of tht:;se verbs are found with for phrases. These for phrases are
used to express the object that the agent receives as part of the exchange; they
are not benefactive for phrases. These verbs show neither the dative nor the
benefactive alternation.
13.7 Berry Verbs
References: Bladin ( 1 9 1 1), E.V. Clark and H.H. Clark ( 1 979), Duszak ( 1 980),
Hale and Keyser ( 1 9 9 1 , 1 992), Jespersen ( 1 942), Karius ( 1 985), Leitner ( 1 974),
Marchand ( 1969, 1 974), Silva ( 1 973)
Class Members: antique, berry, birdnest, blackberry, clam, crab, fish, fowl,
grouse, hay, log, mushroom, nest, nut, oyster, pearl, prawn, rabbit, seal, shark,
shrimp, snail, snipe, sponge, whale, whelk
Properties:
(209) The children like to berry in the summer.
(2 1 0) The children went berrying.
Comments: The verbs in this class are zero-related to nominals. Each of
these verbs relates to collecting or gathering the. entity named by the noun from
which the verb takes its name. These verbs are used almost exclusively in the
-ing form. It is likely that more verbs of this type might be coined.
14 Learn Verbs
Class Members: acquire, cram, glean, learn, memorize, read, study
Properties:
(2 1 1) Rhoda learned French from an old book.
(2 1 2) Rhoda learned from an old book.
Comments: These verbs describe the acquisition of information. The verb
acquire takes a wider range of direct objects than the others: Rhoda acquired
a deep understanding of French grammar. It is also the only verb here that can
be used as a verb of transfer of possession.
Section 15.2
15 Hold and Keep Verbs
References: Dixon (1991)
15.1 Hold Verbs
Class Members: clasp, clutch, grasp, grip, handle, hold, wield
Properties:
(213) She held the rail.
(214) * Conative Alternation:
a. She held the rail.
b. * She held at the rail.
(215) * Middle Alternation:
a. She held the rail.
b. * The rail holds easily.
(216) Body-Part Possessor Ascension Alternation (some verbs):
a. She held his arm.
b. She held him by the arm.
(217) * She held the paper from him.
145
Comments: These verbs describe prolonged contact with an entity, but they
do not describe a change of possession or a change of location. The fact that
only some of these verbs show the body-part possessor ascension alternation
may be attributable to the fact that only some of these verbs take animate direct
objects.
15.2 Keep Verbs
Class Members: hoard, keep, leave, store
Properties:
(218) a. Michelle kept the papers in the desk.
b. Michelle kept the papers behind/over/under the desk.
(219) * Locative Alternation:
a. Michelle kept the papers in the desk.
b. * Michelle kept the desk with the papers.
(220) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a hoard
a store
146 Section 16
Comments: These verbs relate to maintaining something at some location.
They do not describe the actual putting of an entity at this location.
16 Ve rbs of Concealment
Class Members: block, cloister, conceal, curtain, hide, isolate, quarantine,
screen, seclude, sequester, shelter
Properties:
(22 1) Frances hid the presents fr om Sally.
(222) Frances hid the presents behind the books/in the drawer.
(223) *Locative Alternation:
a. Frances hid the presents fr om Sally.
b. *Frances hid Sally of the presents.
Comments: This class includes verbs relating to keeping something out of
vtew.
17 Ve rbs of Throwing
References: C.L. Baker (1992), Dixon (1991), Fillmore (1977b), Gropen et
al. (1989), Jackendoff (1990a, 1990b), Pinker (1989), Snell-Homby (19 83)
17.1 Th row Ve rbs
Class Members: bash, bat, bunt, ?cast, catapult, chuck, fire (projectile), flick,
fling, flip, hit (ball), hurl, kick (ball), knock, lob, ?loft, nudge, pass, pitch, punt,
shoot (projectile), shove, slam, slap, sling, smash, tap, throw, tip, toss
Properties:
(224) Steve tossed the ball.
(225) Directional Phrase :
a. Steve tossed the ball over the fe nce/into the garden.

Section 1 7.2
(226) Steve tossed the ball at Anna.
(227) * Steve tossed Anna with the ball . (cf. pelt)
(228) Dative Alternation (most verbs):
a. Steve tossed the ball to Anna.
b. Steve tossed Anna the ball.
(229) * With/Against Alternation:

b. * The ball tossed.
(232) * Middle Alternation:
a. Steve tossed the softball.
b. * Softballs toss easily.
(233) Z.ero-related Nominal:
a toss
1 47
Comments: These verbs have been described as verbs of "instantaneously
causing ballistic motion" (Gropen et al. ( 1989)) by imparting a force. One
argument of these verbs refers to the entity that is set in motion and that moves
unaccompanied by the agent of the action. These verbs can also be used as
verbs of change of possession by means of change of location, as shown by
their ability to participate in the dative alternation; however, they have not been
cross-listed among the verbs of change of possession (sec. 1 3) . Some of the
verbs in this class are hit verbs that are being used in an extended sense as verbs
of throwing by means of hitting; these verbs are also listed under hit verbs (sec.
1 8 . 1 ) .
17.2 Pelt Verbs
Class Members: buffet, bombard, pelt, shower, stone
Properties:
(234) Steve pelted Anna with acorns.
(235) * Steve pelted acorns at Anna.
148 Section 18
(236) * Directional Phrase:
* Steve pelted acorns over the fence.
(237) * Conative Alternation:
a. Steve pelted Anna (with acorns).
b. * Steve pelted at Anna (with acorns).
(238) * With/Against Alternation:
a. Steve pelted Anna with acorns.
b. * Steve pelted acorns against Anna.
(239) * Dative Alternation:
a. * Steve pelted acorns to Anna.
b. * Steve pelted Anna acorns.
(240) . * Middle Alternation:
a. Steve pelted the squirrels w ith acorns.
b. * Squirrels pelt easily with acorns.
Comments: These verbs, like the throw verbs above, involve ballistic motion,
but they describe the motion of a set of physical objects. They behave quite
differently from the throw verbs: the moving objects are expressed in a with
phrase, and the direct object of these verbs is the "goal" that the moving objects
are set in motion toward.

18.1 Hit Verbs
Class Members: bang, bash, batter, beat, bump, butt, dash, drum, hammer,
hit, kick, knock, lash, pound, rap, slap, smack, smash (where no effect
implicated), strike, tamp, tap, thump, thwack, whack
Properties:

Section 1 8.2
Zero-related Nominal:
a hit/*give a hit/* get a hit in the shoulders
a kick/give a kick/get a kick in the shins
(252)
Comments: These verbs describe moving one entity in order to bring it
into contact with another entity, but they do not necessarily entail that this
contact has any effect on the second entity. A hallmark of these verbs is the
with/against alternation. Some of these verbs allow unintentional, as well as
intentional, action interpretations with body-part or reflexive objects in the with
variant.
At least some of the hit verbs can also be used as throw verbs with the
meaning "instantaneously cause ballistic motion"; those most commonly used
in this way are cross-listed (sec. 1 7 . 1 ) . Some of these verbs are also used as
verbs of sound emission (e.g. , bang) and are cross-listed (sec. 43.2). Such verbs
describe types of contact that are associated with the emission of a characteristic
sound. It is possible that there is a greater overlap between these two classes
of verbs than has been recorded here, since there are other sounds that can
be produced by contact through motion. Some of the hit verbs, mainly those
that are also verbs of sound emission, are found with the preposition on rather
than, or as well as, at in the conative construction (e.g., bang, knock, rap, tap,
thump).
·
18.2 Swat Verbs
Class Members: bite, claw, paw, peck, punch (person), scratch, shoot (gun),
slug, stab, swat, swipe
Properties:
(253) * With/Against Alternation:
a. * Paula swatted the dishcloth against/on the fly.
b. Paula swatted the fly with the dishcloth.
(254) * Through/With Alternation:
a. * Paula swatted the dishcloth through/into the fly.
b. Paula swatted the fly with the dishcloth.
(255) Conative Alternation:
a. Paula swatted the fly.
b. Paula swatted at the fly.
(256) Body-Part Possessor Ascension Alternation:
a. Paula swatted Deirdre on the back.
b. Paula swatted Deirdre's back.
Section 1 8 .3
(257) * Causative Alternations:
a. Paula swatted the fly.
b. * The fly swatted.
(258) * Middle Alternation:
a. Paula swatted flies.
b. * Flies swat easily.
(259) * Instrument Subject Alternation:
a. Paula swatted the fly with a dishcloth.
b. * The dishcloth swatted the fly.
(260) Resultative Phrase (some verbs):
Paula bit the bag open.
(26 1 ) Zero-related Nominal:
a swat/*give a swat/*get a swat on the shoulders
a punch/give someone a punch/get a punch on the nose
1 5 1
Comments: These verbs relate to moving one entity i n order to bring i t into
contact with another entity, but they do not necessarily entail that this contact
has any effect on the second entity. Unlike the hit verbs above, they do not
show the with/against alternation. These verbs are found in the 'NP V NP with
NP' frame, but unlike the hit verbs, they are not found in the 'NP V NP against
NP' frame. Like the hit verbs, they show the conative alternation and the bodypart
possessor ascension alternation. These verbs cannot also be used as throw
verbs. They do not allow instrument subjects. They also do not appear to allow
an unintentional, as well as an intentional, action interpretation with reflexive or
body-part objects (the verb bite might be the exception here), but this property is
probably not surprising since with the hit verbs this interpretation is associated
with the against frame, which the swat verbs do not show. The reciprocal
alternations are not relevant for the same reason.
18.3 Spank Verbs
Class Members: belt, birch, bludgeon, bonk, brain, cane, clobber, club, conk,
cosh, cudgel, cuff, flog, knife, paddle, paddywhack, pummel, sock, spank, strap,
thrash, truncheon, wallop, whip, whisk
Properties:
(262) * With/Against Alternation:
a. * Paula spanked her right hand against the naughty child.
b. Paula spanked the naughty child with her right hand.
! 52 Section 1 8.3
(263) * Through/With Alternation:
a. * Paula spanked her right hand through/into the naughty child.
b. Paula 􀐑panked the naughty child with her right hand.
(264) * Conative Alternation:
· a. Paula spanked the naughty child.
b. * Paula spanked at the naughty child.
(265) Body-Part Possessor Ascension Alternation (some verbs):
a. Paula spanked the naughty child on the back.
b. Paula spanked the naughty child's back.
(266) * Causative Alternations:
a. Paula spanked the naughty child.
b. * The naughty child spanked.
(267) * Middle Alternation:
a. Paula spanked the naughty child.
b. * Naughty children spank easily.
(268) * Instrument Subject Alternation:
a. Paula spanked the naughty child with her right hand.
b. * Paula's right hand spanked the naughty child.
(269) Resultative Phrase:
They flogged/thrashed him to death. ·
(270) -ing Nominal (most verbs):
a spanking/give a spanking/get a spanking
Comments: These verbs refer to moving one entity in order to bring it into
contact with another entity, but they do not necessarily entail that this contact
has any effect on that second entity. This set of verbs is set apart because
many of its members are zero-related to nouns that refer to instruments used
for hitting. Like the hit verbs above, these verbs are found in the ' NP V NP
with NP' pattern, but unlike the hit verbs, they are not found in the 'NP V
NP against NP' pattern. Like the hit verbs, they also 'show the body-part
possessor ascension alternation, but unlike them, they do not show the conative
alternation. These verbs cannot also be used as throw verbs. They do not allow
instrument subjects. They also do not appear to allow an unintentional, as well
as intentional, action interpretation with reflexive or· body-part objects, but this
property is probably not surprising, since with the hit verbs this interpretation
is associated with the against frame , which the spank verbs do not show.
Similarly, the reciprocal alternations are not relevant since the spank verbs are
not found in the ' NP V NP against NP' pattern that gives rise to the together
reciprocal alternation with the hit verbs. These verbs are like the swat verbs in
Section 18.4 153
all respects except that they do not show the conative alternation and, instead
of having zero-related result nominals, have related result nominals of the form
V-ing.
18.4 Non-Agentive Verbs of Contact by Impact
Class Members: bang, brush, bump, crash, hit, knock, ram, slam, smash,
thud
Properties:
(27 1 ) The grocery cart thudded against the wall.
(272) * The wall thudded with the grocery cart. (cf. With/Against Alternation)
(273) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The old cart thudded against the new cart.
b. * The old and new carts thudded.
(274) Together Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive, some verbs) :
a. The old cart thudded against the new cart.
b. The old and new carts thudded together.
Comments: These verbs describe instances of non-agentive contact by impact.
They are used intransitively, taking as complement a prepositional phrase
headed by the preposition against, a frame that could be viewed as the intransitive
counterpart of the 'NP V NP against NP' frame associated with the hit
verbs (cf. above). These verbs are not found in an alternate intransitive frame
involving the preposition with that could be viewed as the intransitive counterpart
of the ' NP V NP with NP' frame also associated with the hit verbs. Some
of these verbs are found in the intransitive together reciprocal alternation.
Some of these verbs are also listed as hit verbs (e.g., hit, bang). Many of
these verbs are also used as verbs of sound emission (e.g., bang, crash; cf. sec.
43.2): such verbs relate to types of contact that are associated with the emission
of a characteristic sound. The overlap between the non-agentive verbs of contact
by impact and the verbs of sound emission is different from that between the
hit verbs and the verbs of sound emission. This difference may arise because
sounds differ as to whether or not their emission can be controlled by an agent.

b. The needle poked the cloth.
(282) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs) :
a poke/give a poke
a pierce , *a stick
Section 1 9
Comments: These verbs describe bringing a pointed object into contact with
a surface and, in some instances, puncturing the surface. The through/with
alternation is characteristic of the verbs in this class.

Section 2 1
Comments: These verbs are pure verbs of contact; they describe surface
contact with no necessary implication that the contact came about through
impact (unlike the verbs of contact by impact; cf. sec. 1 8). These verbs show
a more limited range of properties than the verbs of contact by impact. For
instance, they do not show the conative alternation. But these verbs do show the
body-part possessor ascension alternation, with the possible exception of stroke
and caress, which describe a series of contacts. They only allow intentional
action interpretations with body-part or reflexive objects.
21 Verbs of Cutting
21.1 Cut Verbs
References: Guerssel et al. (1 985), Pinker ( 1 989), Ruhl ( 1 979)
Class Members: chip, clip, cut, hack, hew, saw, scrape, scratch, slash, snip
Properties:
(294) Carol cut the bread with a knife.
(295) Conative Alternation:
a. Carol cut the bread.
b. Carol cut at the bread.
(296) Body-Part Possessor Ascension Alternation (some verbs):
a. Carol cut herself on the thumb.
b. Carol cut her thumb.
(297) * Causative Alternations:
a. Carol cut the bread.
b. * The bread cut.
(298) Middle Alternation:
a. Carol cut the whole wheat bread.
b. Whole wheat bread cuts easily.
(299) Instrument Subject Alternation:
a. Carol cut the bread with a knife.
b. The knife cut the bread.
Section 2 1 .2
(300) Characteristic Property of Instrument Alternation (some verbs):
a. This knife cut the bread.
b. This knife cuts well.
(30 1 ) Unintentional interpretation available (some verbs) :
a. Reflexive Object:

b. B ody-Part Object:
Carol cut her finger.
(302) Path Phrase (some verbs):
Carol cut the paper from one end to the other.
(303) Resultative Phrase:
Carol cut the envelope open.
Carol cut the bread to pieces.
(304) Zero-related Nominal (most verbs):
a cut, *the cut of the paper
get a cut on the finger
1 57
Comments: The meaning of these verbs involves notions of motion, contact,
and effect. Specifically, the meaning of these verbs relates to what Hale and
Keyser ( 1 987) call a "separation in material integrity," but it also includes some
specification concerning the instrument or means used to bring this result about.
The verbs in this class differ from each other in meaning with respect to the
instrument or means. Some of these verbs can be used like build verbs and,
like them, can be found in a benefactive double object construction on this
interpretation; those verbs are cross-listed (sec. 26. 1 ). It is possible that more
cut verbs could potentially show this option. Some of these verbs are also used
as split verbs and have been cross-listed (sec. 23 .2). The cut verbs have been
compared and contrasted with the break verbs; see Break Verbs (sec. 45. 1) for
discussion.
Only some of the cut verbs show the body-part possessor ascension alternation;
this l imitation may arise because only some of them can take body parts
as objects. Some of the cut verbs allow unintentional, as well as intentional,
action interpretations with body part or reflexive objects; certain verbs allowing
this option are also listed as hurt verbs (sec. 40.8.3) since they involve damage
to the body.
21.2 Carve Verbs
Class Members: bore, bruise, carve, chip (potatoes), chop, crop, crush, cube,
dent, dice, drill, file, fillet, gash, gouge, grate, grind, mangle, mash, mince, mow,
158
Section 21.2
nick, notch, perforate, pulverize, punch (paper), prune, shred, slice, slit, spear,
squash, squish
Properties:
(305) Carol carved the stone with a chisel.
(306) * Conative Alternation:
a. Carol carved the stone.
b. * Carol carved at the stone.
(307) * Body-Part Possessor Ascension Alternation:
a. * Carol carved the tree on the hranch.
b. Carol carved the tree 's branch.
(308) *Causative Alternations:
a. Carol carved the stone.
b. *The stone carved.
(309) Middle Alternation:
a. Carol carved the marble.
b. Marble carves easily.
(3 1 0) Instrument Subject Alternation:
a. Carol carved the marble with a chisel.
b. The chisel carved the marble.
(311) Characteristic Property of Instrument Alternation (some verbs):
a. That chisel carved the statue.
b. That chisel carves well.
(3 12) Zero-related Nominal:
a dent, *the dent of the car
put a dent in the car/get a dent in the car
Comments: The meaning of these verbs involves notions of contact and
effect. Their meaning includes a specification of an instrument or a means
(bore) or a specification of the nature of the result (dice); it is possible that these
two types should be assigned separate subclasses. The carve verbs diffe r from
the cut verbs in not showing the conative alternation. They also do not show
the body-part possessor ascension alternation. Some of these verbs have zerorelated
result nominals. Most, but not all, of them allow instrument subjects.
Most of them do not seem to be able to take resultative phrases. Some carve
verbs can be used like build verbs and, like them, can be fo und in the double
object construction on this interpretation; those verbs are cross-listed (sec.
26. 1 ). It is possible that more of these verbs could potentially show this option.
Section 22. 1
22 Verbs of Combining and Attaching
References: Condoravdi and SanfiUppo ( 1 990), Gentner ( 1978)
159
These verbs are all related to combining or attaching. Their hallmark is
participation in the simple reciprocal alternations, the together reciprocal alternations,
or both. Members of this class are never found in the apart reciprocal
alternations. The various subclasses differ according to whether the meanings
of their members involve a result or means component.
22.1 Mix Verbs
Class Members:
with: blend, combine, commingle , concatenate, connect, fuse, join, link, merge,
mingle, mix, pool
into: blend, cream, mix
to: add, connect, join, link, network
Properties:
(3 1 3 ) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. Herman mixed the eggs with the cream. (prepositional variant)
b. Herman mixed the eggs and the cream. (reciprocal variant)
(3 1 4) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive; most verbs):
a. The eggs mixed with the cream.
b. The eggs and the cream mixed.
(3 1 5) Together Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. Herman mixed the eggs with the cream.
b. Herman mixed the eggs and the cream together.
(3 1 6) Together Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive; most verbs) :
a. The eggs mixed with the cream.
b. The eggs and the cream mixed together.
(3 1 7) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (most verbs):
a. I mixed the soap into the water.
The soap mixed into the water.
b. I mixed the soap and the water.
The soap and the water mixed.
(3 1 8) Middle Alternation:
a. I mixed the eggs with cream.
Eggs mix well with cream.
b. I mixed the eggs and cream (together).
Eggs and cream mix well (together).
1 60 Section 22.2
Comments: Unlike the shake verbs discussed below, the mix verbs describe
the ends tate of their direct object and not the way this ends tate is reached. The
most salient property of the mix verbs is that they undergo both the simple
reciprocal alternation and the together reciprocal alternation. These verbs fall
into different subclasses according to which preposition(s) they select when
they take a prepositional phrase complement. When they do not take a prepositional
phrase complement, they need a collective NP as object when transitive
or a collective NP as subject when intransitive. It is possible that some of these
verbs require together when they take a collective NP object in the absence
of a prepositional phrase complement and should have been included among
the shake verbs instead. Judgments about this do not always seem to be clear.
The causative/inchoative alternation is possible with many of these verbs; the
intransitive form of the two reciprocal alternations is possible only with those
verbs that participate in the causative/inchoative alternation.
22.2 Amalgamate Verbs
Class Members:
with: affiliate, alternate, amalgamate, associate, coalesce, coincide, compare,
confederate, confuse, conjoin, consolidate, contrast, correlate, criss-cross, entwine,
entangle, harmonize, incorporate, integrate, interchange, interconnect,
interlace, interlink, interlock, intermingle, interrelate, intersperse, intertwine,
interweave, mate, muddle, ?pair, rhyme, ?team, total, unify, unite
to: engage, introduce, marry, oppose, wed

a. Harriet alternated folk songs with pop songs.
b. Harriet alternated folk songs and pop songs.
(320) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. Plays alternate with ballets.
b. Plays and ballets alternate.
(32 1 ) * Together Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. Harriet alternated folk songs with pop songs.
b. * Harriet alternated folk songs and pop songs together.
(322) * Together Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. Plays alternate with ballets .
b. * Plays and ballets alternate together.
(323) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (most verbs):
a. Harriet interconnected the pieces.
Section 22.3
The pieces interconnected.
b. Harriet alternated folk songs with pop songs.
Folk songs alternated with pop songs.
(324) Middle Alternation:
a. Harriet interconnected the pieces.
The pieces interconnect easily.
b. Harriet alternated folk songs with pop songs.
Folk songs alternate well with pop songs.
161
Comments: The most salient property of the amalgamate verbs is that they
undergo the simple reciprocal alternation, but they are set apart from the other
verbs of combining and attaching in not being found in the together reciprocal
alternation. Unlike the shake verbs discussed below, the amalgamate verbs
describe the ends tate of the direct object and not the way this ends tate is reached.
These verbs fall into different subclasses according to which prepositions they
select when they take a prepositional phrase as complement. When they do
not take a prepositional phrase complement, they need a collective NP as
object when transitive and a collective NP as subject when intransitive. The
causative/inchoative alternation is possible with many of the verbs in this class
that take the preposition with as head of their prepositional phrase complement;
the intransitive form of the simple reciprocal alternation is only found with those
verbs that participate in the causative/inchoative alternation.
22.3 Shake Verbs
References: Leitner ( 1 974)
Class Members:
with: band, beat, bundle, cluster, collate, gather, glom, group, herd, jumble,
lump, mass, package, pair, roll, scramble, shake, shuffle, stir, whip, whisk
into: beat, collect, scramble, shake, shuffle, splice, stir, swirl, whip, whisk
to: append, attach, baste, bind, bond, fasten, fuse, graft, moor, sew, splice, stick,
weld
Properties:
(325) Herman whipped the cream.
(326) Together Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. Herman whipped the sugar into the cream.
b. Herman whipped the sugar and the cream together.
(327) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. Herman whipped the sugar into the cream.
b. * Herman whipped the sugar and the cream.
162
(328)
(329)
* Causative Alternations (with a few exceptions):
a. Herman whipped the sugar into the cream.
* The sugar whipped into the cream.
b. Herman whipped the sugar and the cream together.
* The sugar and the cream whipped together.
Middle Alternation:
a. Herman whipped the sugar into the cream.
Sugar whips into cream easily.
b. Herman whipped the sugar and the cream together.
Sugar and cream whip together easily.
Section 22.4
Comments: The shake verbs differ from the mix verbs discussed above in
specifying the manner in which things are combined, rather than the result of
the combining. These verbs only participate in the together reciprocal alternation,
not in the simple reciprocal alternation. They fall into different subclasses
according to which prepositions they select when they take a prepositional
phrase as complement, although many of the verbs listed above take either
with or into. The verbs taking to do not seem to allow other choices of preposition
while retaining the same sense. When the shake verbs do not take a
prepositional phrase complement, they need a collective NP as object. Most of
these verbs are not found in the causative alternations and, therefore, do not
show the intransitive form of any of the reciprocal alternations. Some of those
verbs which do have an intransitive use are included under the herd verbs; the
properties relating to this use are described there (sec. 47.5.2). Many of these
verbs are also listed under other classes. The tape verbs discussed below behave
exactly like those shake verbs that take the preposition to, except that they are
all related to nominals that name types of fasteners.
22.4 Tape Verbs

Class Members: anchor, band, belt, bolt, bracket, buckle, button, cement,
.chain, clamp, clasp, clip, epoxy, fetter, glue, gum, handcuff, harness, hinge,
hitch, hook, knot, lace, lash, lasso, latch, leash, link, lock, loop, manacle, moor,
muzzle, nail, padlock, paste, peg, pin, plaster, rivet, .rope, screw, seal, shackle,
skewer, solder, staple, stitch, strap, string, tack, tape, tether, thumbtack, tie,
trammel, wire, yoke, zip
Properties:
(330) Linda taped the picture to/on/onto the wall.
Section 22.4
(33 1 ) * Locative Alternation:
a. Linda taped the picture onto the wall.
b. * Linda taped the wall with the picture.
(332) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. Linda taped the label to the cover.
b. * Linda taped the label and the cover.
(333) Together Reciprocal Alternation (transitive) :
a. Linda taped the label to the cover.
b. Linda taped the label and the cover together.
(334) * Causative Alternations:
a. Linda taped the label to the cover.
* The label taped to the cover.
b. Linda taped the label and the cover together.
* The label and the cover taped together.
(335) Middle Alternation:
a. Linda taped the label to the cover.
Labels tape easily to that kind of cover.
b. Linda taped the label and the cover together.
Labels and covers tape together easily.
(336) Resultative Phrase:
Linda taped the box shut.
(337) Cognate With Phrase:
Linda taped the box with two-sided tape.
? Linda taped the box with tape.
(338) Zero-related Nominal:
tape
1 63
Comments: These verbs are like those shake verbs which take to prepositional
phrases, except that they are all zero-related to nouns that name
fasteners-instruments used to attach one thing to another. The meanings of
these verbs, like those of the shake verbs but unlike those of the mix verbs, relate
to the manner/means in which things are combined, rather than the result of
the combining. Although these verbs do not participate in the simple reciprocal
alternation, they participate in the together reciprocal alternation. When they
do not take a prepositional phrase complement, they need a collective NP as
object. When they do take a prepositional phrase complement, they may allow
some locative prepositions other than to to head this PP. Since these verbs are
not found in the causative alternations, they do not show the intransitive form
of the together reciprocal alternation. Like the butter verbs (sec. 9.9), they
1 64
Section 22.5
allow cognate with phrases; the object of with is an NP headed by the noun
that the verb derives its name from. Such with phrases are typically best if
they contribute additional information about the fastener through the use of a
modifier of some kind.
22.5 Cling Verbs
Class Members: adhere, cleave, cling
Properties:
(339) The child clung to her mother.
(340) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The child clung to her mother.
b. * The child and her mother clung.
(341 ) Together Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The child clung to her mother.
b. The child and her mother clung together.
(342) * Causative Alternations:
a. The child clung to her mother.
b. * The war clung the child to her mother.
Comments: These verbs are intransitive verbs describing the attachment of
one entity to a second. Like the shake verbs, they show the together reciprocal
alternation, but since they are intransitive, they show the intransitive version of
this alternation. In the together reciprocal alternation, these verbs need a collective
NP as subject when they do not take a prepositional phrase complement.
They do not have a transitive use.
23 Verbs of Separating and Disassembling
References: Condoravdi ( 1 990)
These verbs are all related to separating or disassembling. They fall into
subclasses according to the participation of their members in the simple reciprocal
alternations or the apart reciprocal alternations. Verbs in this class
are never found in the together reciprocal alternations. The various subclasses
differ according to whether their meanings involve results or means.
Section 23. 1 1 65
23.1 Separate Verbs
Class Members: decouple, differentiate, disconnect, disentangle, dissociate,
distinguish, divide, divorce, part, segregate, separate, sever
Properties:
(343) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. I separated the yolk from the white.
b. I separated the yolk and the white.
(344) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The yolk separated from the white.
b. The yolk and the white separated.
(345) * Apart Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. I separated the yolk from the white.
b.?? I separated the yolk and the white apart.
(346) * Apart Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The yolk separated from the white.
b. * The yolk and the white separated apart.
(347) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (some verbs):
a. I separated the cream from the milk.
The cream separated from the milk.
b. I separated the egg yolk and the egg white.
The egg yolk and the egg white separated.
(348) Middle Alternation:
a. I separated the cream from the milk.
Cream separates easily from milk.
b. I separated the egg yolks and the egg whites.
Egg yolks and egg whites separate easily.
(349) * Locative Alternation:
a. I separated the cream from the milk.
b. * I separated the milk of the cream.
Comments: The characteristic property of the separate verbs is that they
undergo the simple reciprocal alternation, but they are not found in the apart
reciprocal alternation, the inverse of the together reciprocal alternation. Unlike
the split verbs discussed below, the separate verbs have meanings that
specify the endstate of their direct object and not the means or manner in
which this endstate is reached. When these verbs do not take a prepositional
phrase complement, they need a collective NP as object when used transitively
166 Section 23.2
and a collective NP subject when used intransitively. The causative/inchoative
alternation is possible with the verbs in this class.
23.2 Split Verbs
Class Members: blow, break, cut, draw, hack, hew, kick, knock, pry, pull,
push, rip, roll, saw, shove, slip, split, tear, tug, yank
Properties:
(350) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. I broke the twig off (of) the branch.
b. * I broke the twig and the branch.
(on roughly the interpretation of the (a) sentence)
(35 1 ) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The twig broke off (of) the branch.
b. * The twig and the branch broke.
(on roughly the interpretation of the (a) sentence)
(352) Apart Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. I broke the twig off (of) the branch.
b. I broke the twig and the branch apart.
(on roughly the interpretation of the (a) sentence)
(353) Apart Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. The twig broke off (of) the branch.
b. The twig and the branch broke apart.
(on roughly the interpretation of the (a) sentence)
(354) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (most verbs) :
a. I broke the twig off (of) the branch.
The twig broke off (of) the branch.
b. I broke the twig and the branch apart.
The twig and the branch broke apart.
(355) Middle Alternation:
a. I broke twigs off (ot) those branches.
Twigs break off of those branches easily.
b. I broke those twigs and branches apart.
Those twigs and branches break apart easily.
Comments: These verbs are also listed under a variety of other classes,
including the break verbs (sec. 45. 1 ), the cut verbs (sec. 2 1 . 1 ), and the push/pull
verbs (sec. 1 2) . In the use illustrated here, each of these verbs manifests an
extended sense which might be paraphre�sed "separate by V-ing," where "V"
Section 23.4 1 67
is the basic meaning of that verb. It is possible that additional verbs from
these other classes might qualify as split verbs. The split verbs do not describe
inherently reciprocal actions. This property is probably reflected in the fact that
these verbs show the apart reciprocal alternation but not the simple reciprocal
alternation. In the apart reciprocal alternation, they need a collective NP as
object when they do not take a prepositional phrase complement. Many of
these verbs participate in the causative/inchoative alternation, and they are also
found in the intransitive version of the apart reciprocal alternation.
23.3 Disassemble Verbs
References: Bladin ( 1 9 1 1 ), Cruse ( 1 979), Marchand ( 1 973, 1 974)
Class Members: detach, disassemble, disconnect, partition, sift, sunder, unbolt,
unbuckle, unbutton, unchain, unclamp, unclasp, unclip, unfasten, unglue,
unhinge, unhitch, unhook, unlace, unlatch, unlock, unleash, unpeg, unpin,
unscrew, unshackle, unstaple, unstitch, untie, unzip
Properties:
(356) I unscrewed the handle.
(357) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. I unscrewed the handle from the box.
b. * I unscrewed the handle and the box.
(358) * Apart Reciprocal Alternation (transitive):
a. I unscrewed the handle from the box.
b. * I unscrewed the handle and the box apart.
(359) * Causative Alternations (a few exceptions):
a. I unscrewed the handle from the box.
b. * The handle unscrewed from the box.
(360) Middle Alternation:
a. I unscrewed that new handle (from the box).
b. That new handle unscrews (*from the box) easily.
Comments: The meaning of these _verbs includes a specification of the manner
or means in which a separation can be brought about, without specifying
the result of this process. Many of these verbs are formed by attaching the
reversative prefix un- to verbs that belong to the tape class (sec. 22.4); it is
possible that additional members of the tape class might allow for this. The
disassemble verbs are not found in any reciprocal alternations.
23.4 Differ Verbs
Class Members: differ, diverge
1 6 8
Properties:
(361 ) The winter schedule differed from the spring schedule.
(362) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive) :
a. This flyer differs from that flyer.
b. This flyer and that flyer differ.
(363) * Apart Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. This flyer differs from that flyer.
b. * This flyer and that flyer differ apart.
(364) * Causative Alternations:
a. This flyer differs from that flyer.
b. * I differed this flyer from that flyer.
Section 24
Comments: These verbs are intransitive verbs describing a difference, but
not necessarily an actual separation, between one entity and a second. Like the
separate verbs, they show the simple reciprocal alternation, but since they are
intransitive, they show the intransitive version of this alternation. In the simple
reciprocal alternation, these verbs need a collective NP as subject when they
do not take a prepositional phrase complement. They do not have a transitive
counterpart.
24 Verbs of Coloring
Class Members: color, distemper, dye, enamel, glaze, japan, lacquer, paint,
shellac, spraypaint, stain, tint, varnish
Properties:
(365) Phyllis dyed the dress.
(366) Resultative Phrase:
Phyllis dyed the dress blue.
Phyllis dyed the dress a very pale shade of blue.
(367) Cognate With Phrase:
Phyllis dyed the dress with a new colorfast blue dye.
Comments: These verbs describe changing the color of an entity, usually
by the application of some coating that covers the surface of the entity and,
therefore, changes its color. All of these verbs are zero-related to nouns that
Section 25. 1 169
name such coatings. Some works have included these verbs among the butter
verbs (cf. sec. 9.9) since their meaning could be paraphrased as "put X on
(something)," where X is the coating that the verb tak;es its name from. And
these verbs do show the properties of butter verbs. For instance, like them,
they may take a cognate with phrase; the object of with is an NP headed by
the noun that the verb derives its name from, or a noun that bears the hyponym
relation to the noun that the verb derives its name from. Such with phrases are
typically most acceptable if they include a modifier that contributes additional
information about the thing that is being put somewhere. However, unlike the
butter verbs, most verbs of coloring may be found with a resultative phrase,
specifically a phrase expressing the color of the entity that becomes coated as
a result of the action referred to by the verb.
25 Image Creation Verbs
References: Dowty ( 1 99 1 ); Fellbaum and Kegl ( 1 989), Fillmore ( 1 977b),
Fraser ( 1 97 1 ), Rappaport and B. Levin ( 1 985)
This set of verb classes contains verbs relating to the creation of images on
surfaces.
25.1 Verbs of Image Impression
Class Members: applique, emboss, embroider, engrave, etch, imprint, incise,
inscribe, mark, paint, set, sign, stamp, tattoo
Properties:
(368) Smith inscribed his name on the ring.
(369) Smith inscribed his name over the door/under the picture.
(370) Image Impression Alternation:
a. Smith inscribed his name on the ring. (locative variant)
b. Smith inscribed the ring with his name. (with variant)
(37 1 ) Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Smith was inscribing the rings.
b. Smith was inscribing.
(372) Process Nominal:
the inscription of the motto
* the inscription of the wall
110 Section 25.2
(373) Result Nominal:
the inscription (on the wall)
Comments: The hallmark of this subset of the image creation verbs is the
ability to show the image impression alternation (sec. 2.7). This alternation
has sometimes been considered to be an instance of the locative alternation
since it superficially resembles the form of the locative alternation shown by
the spray/load verbs; however, the image impression verbs do not appear to
show the "holistic/partitive" effeCt associated with the spray/load verbs. This
difference may not warrant the recognition of the image impression verbs as a
distinct class if the lack of the "holistic/partitive" effect can receive an independent
explanation. Nevertheless, the image impression verbs have been included
as a distinct class since they form a semantically coherent subset of verbs
whose meaning differs from that of the spray/load verbs. The acceptability of
the image impression verbs in the unspecified object construction varies.
25.2 Scribble Verbs
Class Members: carve, chalk, charcoal, copy, crayon, doodle, draw, forge,
ink, paint, pencil, plot, print, scratch, scrawl, scribble, sketch, spraypaint,
stencil, trace, type, write
Properties:
(374) The jeweller printed the name.
(375) a. The jeweller printed the name on the ring.
b. The jeweller printed the name over the door/under the picture/onto
the cup.
(376) * Image Impression Alternation:
a. The jeweller scribbled his name on the contract.
b. * The jeweller scribbled the contract with his name.
(377) Unspecified Object Alternation (some verbs):
a. Smith was scribbling his notes.
b. Smith was scribbling.
'(378) Zero-related Nominal:
a scribble, a sketch
a crayon, chalk
Comments: Although these verbs belong to the larger class of image creation
verbs, they show only one of the variants of the image impression alternation.
The meaning of most of these verbs includes a specification of a manner or
instrument; a number of them are zero-related to nouns that name instruments
Section 25.4 1 7 1
used for writing or drawing. Those verbs which are not zero-related to nouns
naming instruments have related result nominals, often zero-related nominals.
Some of these verbs also take "effected objects;" they are cross-listed under
the build verbs (sec. 26. 1 ). A few of these verbs-primarily the denominal
ones-do not participate in the unspecified object alternation.
25.3 Illustrate Verbs
Class Members: address, adorn, autograph, brand, date, decorate, embellish,
endorse, illuminate, illustrate, initial, label, letter, monogram, ornament, tag
Properties:
(379) The jeweller decorated the ring.
(380) The jeweller decorated the ring with the name.
(38 1 ) * Image Impression Alternation:
a. * The jeweller decorated the name on the ring.
b. The jeweller decorated the ring with the name.
(382) Process Nominal (some verbs):
the decoration of the room
(383) Result Nominal (some verbs) :
a decoration
(384) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a monogram, an address
Comments: Although these verbs belong to the larger class of image creation
verbs, they show only one of the variants of the image impression alternation.
The meaning of most of these verbs includes a specification of the result of the
image impression process. A number of these verbs, such as autograph and
monogram, are zero-related to a noun that names the "image." Some works have
included verbs like autograph among the butter verbs because their meaning
can be paraphrased as "put X on (something)," where X is the noun the verb
takes its name from; however, they have not been cross-listed under the butter
verbs, since the zero-related noun appears to be a so-called "effected object."
25.4 Transcribe Verbs
References: Sehnert and Sharwood-Smith ( 1 973)
Class Members: copy, film, forge (signature), microfilm, photocopy,
photograph, record, tape, televise, transcribe, type
1 72
Properties:
(385) The secretary transcribed the speech.
(386) * Image Impression Alternation:
a. · The secretary transcribed the speech into the record.
b. * The secretary transcribed the record with the speech.
(387) Zero-related Nominal:
a record, a transcript
a tape, a microfilm
Section 26
Comments: As discussed by Dowty ( 1 99 1 ) , these verbs take as their direct
object a "representation source"; that is, their object refers to the source that
will be used to create a "representation." This set of verbs differs somewhat
from the other verbs included in the larger class of image creation verbs, and it
might actually belong elsewhere in the larger organizational scheme. Transcribe
verbs do not show the image impression alternation. A few may cooccur with a
locative prepositional phrase, but the exact function of this prepositional phrase
requires further investigation. Some of these verbs are zero-related to nouns
that name the medium on which the representation is made. Many have related
result nominals; often these are zero-related nominals.

The members of most of the verb classes identified in this section are transitive
verbs, taking as one argument an agent that creates or transforms an entity;
however, the turn verbs can be used as intransitive verbs that simply describe
the transformation of an entity, without reference to an agent. A subset of the
build verbs, listed separately as the grow verbs, can also be used intransitively.
A number of verbs listed in the various subclasses of verbs of creation and
transformation are also found listed as members of other verb classes. Typically,
these are verbs that have other uses describing activities that might result in the
creation or assembly of an entity; usually, the other uses of these verbs are more
Section 26. 1 1 73
basic. This is particularly true of certain verbs of change of state (especially,
verbs of change of shape and verbs of cooking), verbs of writing, and verbs of
attaching. In their use as verbs of creation and transfonnation, these verbs take
what are called "effected objects"--objects brought into existence as a result
of the action named by the verb-as well as objects that qualify as either raw
material or Dowty 's ( 1 99 1 ) "representation source": paint a picture vs. paint a
view, carve a doll vs. carve wood.
26.1 Build Verbs
Class Members: arrange, assemble, bake, blow (bubbles, glass), build, carve,
cast, chisel, churn, compile, cook, crochet, cut, develop, embroider, fashion,
fold, forge (metal), grind, grow, hack, hammer, hatch, knit, make, mold, pound,
roll, sculpt, sew, shape, spin (wool), stitch, weave, whittle
Properties:
(388) Material/Product Alternation (transitive):
a. Martha carved a toy out of the piece of wood.
b. Martha carved the piece of wood into a toy.
(389) * Total Transfonnation Alternation (transitive):
a. Martha carved the piece of wood into a toy.
b. * Martha carved the piece of wood from a branch into a toy.
/
(390) Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Martha carves toys.
b. Martha carves.
(39 1 ) Benefactive Alternation:
a. Martha carved a toy (out of a piece of wood) for the baby.
Martha carved the baby a toy (out of a piece of wood).
b. Martha carved a piece of wood (into a toy) for the baby.
* Martha carved the baby a piece of wood (into a toy).
(392) * Causative Alternations:
a. Martha carved a toy out of the piece of wood.
* A toy carved out of the piece of wood.
b. Martha carved the piece of wood into a toy.
* The piece of wood carved into a toy.
(393) Raw Material Subject Alternation (some verbs) :
a. Martha carved beautiful toys out of this wood.
b. This wood carves beautiful toys.
1 74 Section 26.2
(394) Sum of Money Subject Alternation (few verbs):
a. The contractor will build (you) a house for $ 1 00,000.
b. $ 1 00,000 will build (you) a house.
Comments: These verbs describe the creation of a product through the transformation
of raw materials. If the creation is done on someone's behalf, then
these verbs are like verbs of obtaining and, like the get verbs, are found in the
benefactive alternation; however, these verbs have not been cross-listed among
the get verbs. Many of the verbs listed here belong to a variety of other classes
in their basic sense (verbs of cooking, verbs of cutting, etc.) and show extended
senses as build verbs. It is possible that additional verbs from these classes
might also show such extended uses. A small subset of build verbs can be used
intransitively; these verbs are listed below as the grow verbs, together with a
description of the properties related to their intransitive use.
26.2 Grow Verbs
Class Members: develop, evolve, grow, hatch, mature
Properties:
(395) Material/Product Alternation (intransitive):
a. That acorn will grow into an oak tree.
b. An oak tree will grow from that acorn.
(396) * Total Transformation Alternation (intransitive):
a. That acorn will grow into an oak tree.
b. * That acorn will grow from a seed into an oak tree.
(397) Causative/lnchoative Alternation:
a. The gardener grew that acorn into an oak tree.
That acorn will grow into an oak tree.
b. The gardener grew an oak tree from that acorn.
An oak tree will grow from that acorn.
Comments:. These verbs simply describe the transformation of an entity from
one form to another; either the source or the goal may be the subject of the verb,
with the other being expressed in a prepositional phrase. Thus the members
of this class show an alternation that might be considered the intransitive
(unaccusative) counterpart of the material/product alternation shown by the
build verbs. With the possible exception of mature, these verbs participate
in the causative/inchoative alternation. When used. transitively, they show the
behavior of build verbs and are cross-listed with these ( cf. above); the properties
related to their transitive use are described under Build Verbs.
Section 26.4 1 75
26.3 Verbs of Preparing
References: Jackendoff ( 1 990a, 1990b), Wierzbicka ( 1 988c)
Class Members: bake (cake), blend (drink), boil (egg, ·tea), brew (coffee),
clean, clear (path), cook (meal), fix (meal), fry (egg), grill, hardboil (egg),
iron, light (fire), mix (drink), poach (egg), pour (drink), prepare (meal), roast
(chicken), roll, run (bath), scramble (egg), set (table), softboil (egg), toast, toss
(salad), wash
Properties:
(398) Donna fixed a sandwich.
(399) * Material/Product Alternation (transitive):
a. ? Donna fixed a sandwich from last night's leftovers.
b. * Donna fixed last night's leftovers into a sandwich.
( 400) Benefactive Alternation:
a. Donna fixed a sandwich for me.
b. Donna fixed me a sandwich.
(40 1 ) * Causative Alternations:
a. Donna fixed a sandwich.
b. * A sandwich fixed.
Comments: The term "verbs of preparing" comes from Wierzbicka ( 1 988c ).
Many of these verbs describe the preparation of food; most of the remainder
deal with other types of household activities. These verbs describe the creation
of a product, usually through the transformation of raw materials. However,
they are not found in the material/product alternation, since they may only
take the product ("effected object") as direct object. The raw material may be
expressed in a prepositional phrase, though often these verbs seem best when
the raw material is not expressed at all. Some of these verbs take as direct
objects NPs that can refer to either the raw material or the product (e.g., cake
can refer to either the batter or the baked cake), although with these verbs such
NPs have the product interpretation.
When the preparation is done on someone's behalf, then these verbs are
like verbs of obtaining and, like th􀐍 get verbs, are found in the benefactive
alternation; however, they have not been cross-listed. A number of these verbs
are verbs of cooking in their basic sense ( cf. sec. 45.3) and are cross-listed here;
possibly, more verbs of cooking could have been included here.
26.4 Create Verbs
Class Members: coin, compose; compute, concoct, construct, create, derive,
design, dig, fabricate, form, invent, manufacture, mint, model, organize,
produce, recreate, style, synthesize
176
Properties:
(402) * Material/Product Alternation (transitive):
a. David constructed a house (out of/from bricks).
b. * David constructed the bricks into a house.
(403) * Benefactive Alternation (most verbs):
a. David constructed a house for me.
b. * David constructed me a house.
(404) * Causative Alternations:
a. David constructed the house.
b. * The house constructed.
(405) * Raw Material Subject Alternation:
a. David constructed a house from those new bricks.
b. * Those new bricks constructed a house.
Section 26.5
(406) * David constructed the mansion [from bricks] [into a house].
Comments: This set of verbs of creation and transformation takes an "effected
object"-an NP that refers to the created object. Many of them can
take a from phrase specifying the raw material that the product was created
from, but none of them can express the raw material as a direct object. Thus,
these verbs are not found in the material/product alternation. Although they are
found with benefactive for phrases, few, if any, of them are found in the double
object construction; this might be due to the so-called Latinate restriction on
this construction (see sec. 2. 1 , Dative Alternation).
26.5 Knead Verbs
Class Members: beat, bend, coil, collect, compress, fold, freeze, knead, melt,
shake, squash, squish, squeeze, twirl, twist, wad, whip, wind, work
Properties:
( 407) * Material/Product Alternation (transitive):
a. I kneaded the dough (into a loaf).
b. * I kneaded a loaf (from the dough).
(408) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (some verbs):
a. I kneaded the dough (into a loaf).
* The dough kneaded (into a loaf).
b. I twirled the dough into a pretzel.
The dough twirled into a pretzel.
Section 26.6
(409) * Raw Material Subject Alternation:
a. * I kneaded a good loaf from this dough.
b. * This dough kneads a good loaf.
(4 1 0) * Total Transformation Alternation (transitive):
a. I kneaded the dough into a loaf.
b. * I kneaded [the dough] [from a lump] [into a loaf] .
1 7 7
Comments: The members of this subset of the verbs of creation and trans- .
formation are also not found in the material/product alternation. These verbs
describe the bringing about of a change of shape in an entity; this transformation
can be viewed as a type of creation. They take the raw material/original shape
as their qirect object and express the product/resultant shape in a prepositional
phrase. They do not allow the product to be expressed as their direct object.
Many of these verbs are also listed as verbs of change of state (sec. 45) or as
verbs of combining (sec. 22); it is possible that more verbs from those classes
would also show the behavior of this set of verbs. Some of the verbs that are
cross-listed require the into phrase in this sense (e.g. , twirl).
26.6 Turn Verbs
Class Members: alter, change, convert, metamorphose, transform, transmute,
tum
Properties:
( 4 1 1 ) The witch turned him from a prince into a frog.
( 4 1 2) Total Transformation Alternation (transitive):
a. The witch turned him into a frog.
b. The witch turned him from a prince into a frog.
(4 1 3) Total Transfon:nation Alternation (intransitive; most verbs):
a. He turned into a frog.
b. He turned from a prince into a frog.
(41 4) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (most verbs):
a. The witch turned him into a frog.
He turned into a frog.
b. The witch turned him from a prince into a frog.
He turned from a prince into a frog.
(4 1 5) * Material/Product Alternation (transitive) :
a. * The witch turned him from a prince.
b. The witch turned him into a frog.
178 Section 26.7
( 4 1 6) * Material/Product Alternation (intransitive):
a. * He turned from a prince.
b. He turned into a frog.
( 417) * The witch turned him.
Comments: These verbs describe a complete transformation; most of them
participate in the causative/inchoative alternation and, therefore, are found
in transitive and intransitive forms. These verbs take the following three
arguments, whether transitive or intransitive: the entity undergoing the transformation,
as well as the initial ("source") and final ("goal") forms of this entity.
When transitive, these verbs also take an agent. The entity undergoing the
transformation is always expressed as the direct object if the verb is transitive,
and as the subject if the verb is intransitive; the other arguments are expressed
in prepositional phrases. The final state always must be expressed, while the
initial state can only be expressed if the final state is expressed. These verbs do
not participate in the material/product alternation.
26.7 Performance Verbs
References: P. Austin ( 1982), Dowty ( 1 99 1 )
Class Members: chant (prayer), choreograph (dance), compose (symphony),
dance (waltz), direct (movie, play), draw (picture), hum (tune), intone (prayer),
perform (play), paint (picture), play (music, game), produce (movie), recite
(poem), silkscreen, sing (song), spin (story), take (picture), whistle (tune),
write (book)
Properties:
(4 1 8) Sandy sang.
(4 1 9) Sandy sang a song/a ballad.
(420) Dative Alternation (some verbs):
a. Sandy sang a song to me.
b. Sandy sang me a song.
(42 1 ) Benefactive Alternation (some verbs):
a. Sandy sang a song for me.
b. Sandy sang me a song.
(422) Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Sandy sang a song.
h. Sandy sang.
Section 27
(423) * Causative Alternations:
a. Sandy sang a song.
b. * The song sang.
1 79
Comments: Like many of the other verbs of creation and transformation,
all of these verbs take effected objects and do not allow the expression of a
raw material argument. These verbs describe performances, broadly speaking,
and these performances are themselves the effected object. Some of these
verbs appear to allow either the benefactive or the dative alternation. When
these verbs are found in the double object form, it may not always be clear .
whether it is the benefactive or the dative interpretation that is intended; the
alternating verbs have only been listed under the benefactive alternation in
Part I. Further study" is needed to determine whether it is simply difficult to
distinguish these two interpretations with this set of verbs or whether there are in
fact two interpretations. It is also possible that if the double object construction
is associated with two interpretations, these interpretations are associated with
different senses of these verbs. The waltz verbs, although listed under verbs of
motion (sec. 5 1 .5), could also be viewed as performance verbs.
27 Engender Verbs
Class Members: beget, cause, create, engender, generate, shape, spawn
Properties:
(424) Racial inequality engenders conflict.
(425) * Causative Alternations:
a. Racial inequality engenders conflict.
b. * Conflict engenders.
Comments: These verbs describe a causal relationship between the two
arguments, which are typically both abstract NPs. One argument brings about
the existence of the other.
1 80 Section 28
28 Calve Verbs
References: B ladin ( 1 9 1 1 ), E. V. Clark and H.H. Clark ( 1 979), Duszak ( 1 980),
Hale and Keyser ( 1 99 1 , 1 992), Jespersen ( 1 942), Karius ( 1 985), Marchand
( 1 969, 1 974)
Class Members: calve, cub; fawn, foal, kitten, lamb, litter, pup, spawn, whelp
Properties:
( 426) The cat kittened.
Comments: The verbs in this class are zero-related to nominals, which are
the names of the young of certain animals. Each of these verbs relates to giving
birth to the animal from which the verb takes its name.
29 Verbs with Predicative Complements
References: J.L. Austin ( 1 962), Bolinger ( 1 973), Barkin ( 1 973, 1 984),
Curme ( 1 9 3 1 ) , Dixon ( 1 99 1 ), Dowty ( 1 99 1 ) , Emonds ( 1985), J. McCawley
( 1 977), Poutsma ( 1 904), Quirk et al. ( 1 985), Sinha ( 1 973), Stowell ( 1 989,
199 l a, 1 99 1 b), Vendler ( 1 972), Wier􀐎bicka ( 1 987)
The verbs in this section are used to characterize or describe properties of entities.
The hallmark of these verbs is that they all take predicative complements.
Most of the subclasses include verbs which have the predicative complement
predicated of the immediately postverbal NP. The masquerade verbs are the
exception; they have the predicative complement predicated of their subject.
The verbs in this class are found in a variety of frames. The most wellrepresented
are the frames ' NP V NP NP' , ' NP V NP as NP' , ' NP V NP to be
NP' , as well as their counterparts with adjective phrases 'NP V NP AP', 'NP V
NP as AP' , 'NP V NP to be AP' ; the adjectival frames are not treated here. In
each of these frames, a predicative complement expressed by the second NP or
the AP is predicated of the immediately postverbal NP. The frame associated
with two postverbal NPs ('NP V NP NP') superficially resembles the double
object variant associated with the dative alternation. Despite the superficial
similarity, the two frames are given different syntactic analyses. The ' NP NP'
sequence associated with the as alternation is often analyzed as a small clause.
None of the verbs in this class show the dative alternation.
The verbs fall into subclasses according to the frames they are found in.
Since it is sometimes difficult to determine which of the possible frames a
Section 29.2 1 8 1
given verb i s associated with, the classification will need t o b e refined. Some
of these verbs also take other types of sentential complements, but these are
not treated systematically here. Further study is needed to identify the finer
semantic criteria that distinguish between the verb classes identified in this
section.
29.1 Appoint Verbs
Class Members: acknowledge, adopt, appoint, consider, crown, deem, designate,
elect, esteem, imagine, mark, nominate, ordain, proclaim, rate, reckon,
report, want
Properties:
(427) As Alternation:
a. The president appointed Smith press secretary.
b. The president appointed Smith as press secretary.
(428) * Dative Alternation:
a. The president appointed Smith press secretary.
b. * The president appointed press secretary to Smith.
(429) Infinitival Copular Clause (some verbs):
The president appointed Smith 􀐏o be press secretary.
Comment11: These verbs may take two postverbal NPs or a postverbal NP
followed by an as phrase. It is not clear what determines whether a verb belongs
to this class or to the characterize or dub classes below. Possibly, this class
should not be recognized as a separate class; it may be preferable to list the
verbs in it under both the dub verbs and the characterize verbs. Some of the
listed verbs take other types of sentential complements, but those are not treated
here.
29.2 Characterize Verbs
Class Members: accept, address, appreciate, bill, cast, certify, characterize,
choose, cite, class, classify, confirm, count, define, describe, diagnose, disguise,
employ, engage, enlist, enroll, enter, envisage, establish, esteem, hail,
herald, hire, honor, identify, imagine, incorporate, induct, intend, lampoon,
offer, oppose, paint, portray, praise, qualify, rank, recollect, recommend, regard,
reinstate, reject, remember, represent, repudiate, reveal, salute, see, select,
stigmatize, take, train, treat, use, value, view, visualize
Properties:
( 430) * As Alternation:
a. Angela characterized Shelly as a lifesaver.
b. * Angela characterized Shelly a lifesaver.
182 Section 29.3
(43 1) Infinitival Copular Clause (few verbs):
*Angela characterized Shelly to be a lifesaver.
Angela imagined Shelly to be the perfect candidate.
Comments: These verbs allow only the frame 'NP V NP as NP' and not the
frame involving two postverbal NPs. Some of these verbs also figure among
the admire-type psych-verbs and the judgment verbs. Interestingly, very few
of these verbs are fo und in the 'NP V NP to be NP' frame. Some of them may
take other kinds of sentential complements. The impossibility of the dative
alternation is not illustrated here, since the verbs appear in neither of the
frames associated with this alternation.
29.3 Dub Ve rbs
Class Members: anoint, baptize, brand, call, christen, consecrate, crown,
decree; dub, label, make, name, nickname, pronounce, rule, stamp, style, term,
vote
Properties:
(432) *As Alternation:
a. The captain named the ship Seafarer.
b. * The captain named the ship as Seafarer.
(433) *Dative Alternation:
a. The captain named the ship Seafarer.
b. * The captain named Seafarer to the ship. ·
(434) *Infinitival Copular Clause:
* The captain named the ship to be Seafarer.
Comments: Almost all of these verbs relate to the bestowing of names.
These verbs allow only the frame involving two postverbal NPs, and not the
frame 'NP V NP as NP '. None of these verbs are fo und in the infinitival
copular clause frame, 'NP V NP to be NP '. There may be some differences of
opinion concerning whether all of the dub verbs really do not allow infinitival
complements; if some do allow them, those verbs should be included with the
declare verbs below, which differ from the dub verbs in this respect.
29.4 Declare Ve rbs
Class Members: adjudge, adjudicate, assume, avow, believe, confess,
declare, fa ncy, find, judge, presume, profess, prove, suppose, think, warrant
Properties:
( 435) *As Alternation:
a. The president declared Smith press secretary.
b. * The president declared Smith as press secretary.
'Section 29.6
(436) * Dative Alternation:
a. The president declared Smith press secretary.
b. * The president declared Smith to press secretary.
(437) Infinitival Copular Clause:
The president declared Smith to be press secretary.
( 438) The president declared that Smith would be press secretary.
1 83
Comments: Like the dub verbs above, these verbs allow only the frame
involving two postverbal NPs and not the frame 'NP V NP as NP' . However,
unlike the dub verbs, these verbs are found in the infinitival copular clause
frame, 'NP V NP to be NP' . Some of them may take other kinds of sentential
complements. There may be some differences of opinion concerning whether
all of the declare verbs really do allow infinitival complements; if some do not
allow them, they should be included with the dub verbs, which differ from the
declare verbs in this respect.
29.5 Conjecture Verbs
Class Members: admit, allow, assert, conjecture, deny, discover, feel, fi gure,
grant, guarantee, guess, hold, know, maintain, mean, observe, recognize, repute,
show, suspect
Properties:
( 439) * As Alternation:
a. * The press conjectured Smith the appointee.
b. * The press conjectured Smith as the appointee.
( 440) Infinitival Copular Clause:
The press conjectured Smith to be the appointee.
(44 1 ) The press conjectured that Smith would be the appointee.
Comments: These verbs allow neither the frame involving two postverbal
NPs nor the frame 'NP V NP as NP' ; however, they are found in the infinitival
copular clause frame, 'NP V NP to be NP' . Some of these verbs take types of
sentential complements other than those listed here. The impossibility of the
dative alternation is not illustrated here, since the verbs appear in neither of the
frames associated with this alternation.
29.6 Masquerade Verbs
Class Members: act, behave, camouflage, count, masquerade, officiate, pose,
qualify, rank, rate, serve
1 84 Section 29.7
Properties:
(442) Dina masqueraded as a lawyer.
(443) * Dina masqueraded a lawyer.
Comments: The verbs in this class take a predicative complement predicated
of their subject. They require as to introduce this complement.
29.7 Orphan Verbs
References: Bladin ( 1 9 1 1 ) , E.V. Clark and H.H. Clark ( 1 979), Jespersen
( 1 942), Karius ( 1 985), Leitner ( 1 974), Marchand ( 1 969, 1 974)
Class Members: apprentice, canonize, cripple, cuckold, knight, martyr,
orphan, outlaw, pauper, recruit, widow
Properties:
( 444) The king knighted the brave soldier.
(i.e., The king made the brave soldier a knight.)
(445) Passive:
The soldier was knighted (l?y the king).
Comments: With the exception of canonize, the verbs in this class are zerorelated
to nouns. The meaning of these verbs can be paraphrased so that the
zero-related noun is a predicative complement of a verb like make. For example,
the meaning of the verb knight is roughly "make (someone) a knight"; the noun
knight is being predicated of the surface object of the verb. These verbs are
often used in the passive, typically the adjectival passive.

Section 30. 1 185
Comments: The verbs in this class are zero-related to nouns. The meaning
of these verbs can be paraphrased so that the zero-related noun is a predicative
complement of a verb like act. For instance, the verb tutor.means roughly "act
as a tutor for/toward." In the paraphrase, the noun zero-related to the verb is
being predicated of the surface subject of the verb. The person toward whom
the action is directed may be expressed as the object of the verb or the object of
a prepositional phrase complement of the verb; the actual expression depends
on the verb.

Comments: The verbs in this subset of the verbs of perception describe
the actual perception of some entity. They take the perceiver as subject and
what is perceived as direct object. Some of these verbs are tied to a particular
sense modality, but others are not. These verbs take a variety of sentential
complements; however, there is no attempt to deal fully with the range of
possible sentential complements here, although much of the discussion of
these verbs in the literature focuses on this issue. (The verbs taste and smell
are exceptional; they do not show as wide a range of options as the other class
members, possibly because only a limited range of things can be apprehended
through the sense of taste and smell.) The question of whether or not these verbs
are stative has also received substantial attention; this issue arises because
these verbs are often odd in the progressive, unless they receive a special
interpretation.
30.2 Sight Verbs
Class Members: descry, discover, espy, examine, eye, glimpse, inspect, investigate,
note, observe, overhear, perceive, recognize, regard, savor, scan,
scent, scrutinize, sight, spot, spy, study, survey, view, watch, witness
Properties:

( 458) * The crew is spotting the island.
( 459) * The crew spotted at the island.
(460) * We spotted that they were running. (except: observe, note, perceive)
( 46 1 ) We spotted them running.
(462) * We spotted them run.
Section 30.4
(463) * Middle Alternation:
a. I spotted the runaway cat.
b. * Runaway cats spot easily.
1 87
Comments: This subset of the verbs of perception again take the perceiver
as subject and what is perceived as direct object. Although some of these verbs
are tied to a particular sense modality, others are not. These verbs are set apart
from the see verbs above because they take a more limited range of complement
types. Again, no attempt is made here to deal fully with the range of possible
sentential complements, even though much of the discussion of these verbs in
the literature focuses on this issue.
30.3 Peer Verbs
Class Members: check (on), gape, gawk, gaze, glance, glare, goggle, leer,
listen (to), look, ogle, peek, peep, peer, sniff, snoop (on), squint, stare
Properties:
(464) We peered at the baby/around the room/through the screen/into the
closet.
We listened to the baby.
We checked/snooped on them.
( 465) * We peered the baby.
( 466) * We peered that all was well.
( 467) We peered at them running.
( 468) * We peered at them run.
Comments: Unlike the see and sight verbs above, the verbs in this subset of
the verbs of perception are not used transitively; rather they take a prepositional
phrase complement. These verbs do not necessarily describe the apprehension
of something via a sense: one can look at something without seeing it. The
members of this subset show a limited range of sentential complements. All the
verbs in this set involve sight, except for the verbs sniff and listen. Almost all
of the verbs in this set take the preposition at or one of the locative prepositions
as the head of their prepositional phrase complement. However, the verb listen
differs in requiring the preposition to and in 􀐐llowing infinitival complements
(We listened to them playing), while the verbs check and snoop require the
preposition on.
30.4 Stimulus Subject Perception Verbs
Class Members: feel, look, smell, sound, taste
1 8 8
Properties:
(469) That pea soup tasted delicious.
(470) That pea soup tasted delicious to me.
(47 1 ) * Passive:
* I was tasted delicious to (by the pea soup).
Section 3 1
Comments: The members of this set of verbs of perception, like the peer
verbs above, are intransitive. But unlike the other types of verbs of perception,
they do not take the perceiver as their subject. Rather, these verbs take the
stimulus as their subject and express the perceiver in a to prepositional phrase.
In addition, these verbs take an adjective phrase complement predicated of the
stimulus.
Due to the use of a to phrase to express the perceiver, these verbs are
sometimes discussed in the context of psych-verbs; compare the use of the
to phrase with psych-verbs to express an experiencer, as in The outcome was
perplexing to me. In fact, with this set of verbs the perceiver is often referred
to as the experiencer.

Verbs of psychological state typically take two arguments. Although there
is some controversy over how best to characterize the "semantic roles" of
these two arguments, most frequently these arguments are characterized as the
experiencer and the stimulus (or sometimes theme, cause, object of emotion, or
target of emotion). In terms of the expression of these arguments, it is possible
to distinguish four classes of psychological verbs in English: the members
of two classes are transitive verbs, and the members of the other two classes
are intransitive verbs taking prepositional phrase complements. The transitive
psych-verbs are the most numerous. They fall into two classes according to
whether the experiencer is the subject (the admire verbs) or the object (the
amuse verbs). The intransitive psych-verbs fall into two classes according to
whether the experiencer is expressed as the subject (the marvel verbs) or as
the object of the preposition heading a prepositional phrase complement (the
appeal verbs). In addition to the references listed above, there are also many
studies that deal with psychological verbs in other languages.

Comments: The members of this subclass of the psych-verbs describe the
bringing about of a change in psychological or emotional state. They are transitive
verbs whose object is the experiencer of the emotion and whose subject
is the cause of the change in psychological state. It is possible that the verbs included
in this class should be further subdivided. For instance, Grimshaw ( 1 990)
argues that some of these verbs, such as amuse, allow the subject/stimulus argument
to receive an agentive interpretation, while others, such as concern, do
not; this distinction could be the basis for further subdivision of these verbs.
Some of the verbs in this class also are used in a physical action sense; among
them are agitate, depress, hit, strike (e.g., The carpenter depressed the lever).
In English, unlike in some languages, few amuse-type psych-verbs are found
,in transitive/intransitive pairs of the type associated with the causative alternations;
that is, the only intransitive use of these verbs with an experiencer
subject receives a middle interpretation. However, there are some exceptions,
including the verbs cheer, delight, enthuse, gladden, grieve, madden, obsess,
puzzle, sadden, sicken, thrill, tire, weary, worry; these verbs are also listed
among the marvel verbs below.
The binding properties of these verbs have received much attention recently;
see Belletti and Rizzi ( 1 988), Giorgi ( 1 984), Grimshaw ( 1 990), Johnson ( 1 986 ),
Pesetsky ( 1 987, 1 992), among others, for some discussion. The references cited
at the beginning of this section also discuss various properties of these verbs that
are not included here, since they do not directly involve their argument-taking
properties.
31.2 Admire Verbs
Class Members:
PoSITIVE VERBS: admire, adore, appreciate, cherish, enjoy, esteem, exalt, .fancy,
favor, idolize, like, love, miss, prize, respect, relish, revere, savor, stand, support,

* the movie's enjoyment by the children
(493) -able Adjective:
detestable, enjoyable, hatable, likable
(494) -er Nominal:
admirer of Roman ruins, dog-hater, music-lover, respecter of privacy
Comments: The members of this subclass of the psych-verbs are transitive
verbs with an experiencer subject. There are a variety of opinions as to the best
characterization of the "semantic role" of their direct object; the labels used
include theme, target of emotion, stimulus, and subject matter. These verbs
vary as to whether they allow sentential complements and, if so, which types.
Some of the verbs that take sentential complements allow expletive it in object
position with an extraposed sentential complement.
31.3 Marvel Verbs
Class Members:
about: bother, care, fret, mind, moon, rage, rejoice, rhapsodize, worry
at: cheer, cringe, enthuse, exult, fume, gladden, madden, marvel, rage, rejoice,
sadden, sicken, swoon, thrill, wonder

to: react, thrill
Properties:
(495) Megan marveled at the beauty of the Grand Canyon.
(496) Passive (some verbs):
The beauty of the Grand Canyon has been marveled over by countless
tourists.
Comments: The members of this set of psych-verbs are intransitive verbs.
Each takes an experiencer subject and expresses the stimulus/object of emotion
in a prepositional phrase headed by one of a variety of prepositions. These
verbs are not often singled out for discussion, and if they are mentioned, they
are often lumped with the admire verbs. However, they do not show as wide a
range of behavior as either of the types of transitive psych-verbs. Some of these
verbs are used transitively as amuse verbs (cf. above); these are cross-listed.
31.4 Appeal Verbs
Class Members:
at: niggle
on: grate, jar
to: appeal, matter
Properties:
( 497) This painting appeals to Malinda.
(498) * Passive:
* Malinda is appealed to (by this painting).
Comments: This class is the smallest of the four psych-verb subclasses. Its
members are intransitive verbs taking the stimulus as subject and expressing the
experiencer in a prepositional phrase headed by one of a variety of prepositions.
These verbs do not show the range of behavior that either of the transitive
types of psych-verbs show. Their pattern of argument expression in some ways
resembles a pattern that is more prevalent in other languages, where psychverbs
often express the stimulus as a nominative NP and the experiencer as a
dative NP.

32 Verbs of Desire
References: Bolinger ( l 972b ), Borkin ( 1 972), Dirven ( 1 989), Dixon ( 1 99 1 ),

( 1 985), Wierzbicka ( 1 988b). See Psych-Verbs above for further references.
These verbs are sometimes included among the psych-verbs that take an
experiencer subject, that is, the admire-type and marvel-type psych-verbs. Like
them, these verbs take two arguments and fall into two classes: a transitive class
and an intransitive class. In addition, one of the two arguments, the person
that desires something, is often considered to be a type of experiencer, and
like the experiencer argument of the admire and marvel verbs, this argument
is expressed as the subject of the verbs of desire. These verbs express their
second argument, the thing desired, differently according to whether they are
transitive (the want verbs) or intransitive (the long verbs); this argument is
expressed as the direct object of the verb if the verb is transitive, or as the
object of a preposition heading a prepositional phrase complement if the verb
is intransitive.
32.1 Want Verbs
Class Members: covet, crave, desire, fancy, need, want
Properties:
(499) Dorothy needs new shoes.

thank, toast, welcome
NEGATIVE VERBS: abuse, backbite, calumniate, castigate, censure, chasten,
chastise, chide, condemn, criticize, decry, defame, denigrate, denounce, deprecate,
deride, disparage, fault, fine, impeach, insult, lambaste, malign, mock,
penalize, persecute, prosecute, punish, rebuke, reprimand, reproach, reprove,

(5 1 2) As Alternation (some verbs):
a. They praised them as volunteers.
b. * They praised them volunteers.
(5 1 3) Process Derived Nominal (some verbs):
· the committee's condemnation of the policy
the policy's condemnation by the committee
the condemnation of the policy by the committee
Comments: These verbs share some properties with the admire-type psychverbs
(sec. 3 1 .2). While the admire verbs relate to a particular feeling that
someone may have in reaction to something, these verbs relate to a judgment or
opinion that someone may have in reaction to something. Unlike the admiretype
psych-verbs, they do not typically take sentential complements as objects,
but they may take gerunds expressed in ajar phrase. Although judgment verbs
can have related -able adjectives and -er nominals, these forms do not always
sound very natural. Many of these verbs do not have derived nominals with a
process interpretation.
34 Verbs of Assessment
References: Deane and Wheeler ( 1984)
Class Members: analyze, assess, audit, evaluate, review, scrutinize, study
Properties:
(5 1 4) The inspector analyzed the building.
(5 1 5 ) Possessor Object Possessor-Attribute Factoring Alternation:
a. The inspector analyzed the building 's soundness.
b. The inspector analyzed the building for its s􀐌undness.
(5 1 6) * Attribute Object Possessor-Attribute Factoring Alternation:
a. The inspector analyzed the building's soundness.
b. * The inspector analyzed the soundness in the building.
Comments: These verbs relate to making an assessment of something with
respect to some attribute. They are found in one of the possessor-attribute
factoring alternations: the possessor object alternation. These verbs differ from
the admire-type psych-verbs (sec. 3 1 .2) and the judgment verbs above, which
also participate in this alternation, in simply indicating the assessment, without
specifying a judgment or a feeling that reflects the outcome of the assessment.

1 99 1 ), Dowty ( 1 979), Ljung ( 1980), J. McCawley ( 1 968a, 1 973, 1974), Partee
( 1 974), Quine ( 1 960), Quirk ( 1 970), Sibley ( 1 955)
All the verbs in this section relate to searching. There seem to be three ways
in which these verbs can express their arguments: 'NP1 V NP2 in NP3 ', 'NP 1 V
NP3 for NP2 ' , 'NP 1 V for NP2 in NP3 ' ; this collection of frames is discussed
in Part I under Search Alternations (sec. 2. 1 1 ) . Different verbs are found in .
different combinations of these patterns. With the exception of the ferret verbs,
all of these verbs permit the use of a for phrase to express the object being
searched for. In general, the argument that refers to the entity that is being
searched for is something whose existence is not presupposed. When a PP is
used to expressed the place where the search is being carried out, this PP can
usually be headed by one of a variety of locative prepositions; the prepositions
in, through, and among are particularly common.
One of the controversies that has surrounded these verbs is whether look
for is the same as "try to find," as proposed in Quine ( 1960), Bach ( 1 968),
and J. McCawley ( 1 968a), and criticized in Dougherty ( 1970), followed by a
response in J. McCawley ( 1 973).
35.1 Hunt Verbs
Class Members: dig, feel, fish, hunt, mine, poach, scrounge
Properties:
(5 17) a. I hunted the woods for game.
b. I hunted for game in the woods.
I hunted in the woods for game.
c. I hunted game in the woods.
(5 1 8) Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. I was hunting game (in the woods).
b. I was hunting (in the woods).
Comments: The members of this class show all three of the possible patterns
of argument expression available to verbs of searching. With the possible exception
of scrounge, these verbs allow the unspecified object alternation. They
may take a range of locative prepositions heading the locative prepositional
phrase.
198 Section 35.2
35.2 Search Verbs
Class Members: advertise, check, comb, dive, drag, dredge, excavate, patrol,
plumb, probe, prospect, prowl, quarry, rake, rifle, scavenge, scour, scout, search,
shop, sift, trawl, troll, watch
Properties:
(5 1 9) a. I searched the cave for treasure.
b. I searched for treasure in the cave.
I searched in the cave for treasure.
c. * I searched treasure in the cave.
Comments: The members of this class show two of the three possible patterns
of expressing arguments. They do not show the pattern where the object being
searched for is the direct object of the verb. Many of these verbs are most
often found with through as the preposition heading the locative prepositional
phrase.
35.3 Stalk Verbs
Class Members: smell, stalk, taste, track
Properties:
(520) a. I stalked the woods for game.
b. * I stalked for game in the woods.
* I stalked in the woods for game.
c. I stalked game in the woods.
Comments: The members of this class show two of the three possible patterns
of argument expression available to verbs of searching. They do not
show the pattern where both arguments are expressed in prepositional phrases.
These verbs may take a range of locative prepositions heading the locative
prepositional phrase.
35.4 Investigate Verbs
Class Members: canvass, explore, examine, frisk, inspect, investigate,
observe, quiz, raid, ransack, riffle, scan, scrutinize, survey, tap
Properties:
(52 1 ) a . We investigated the area for bombs.
b. * We investigated for bombs in the area.
* We investigated in the area for bombs.
c. * We investigated bombs in the area.
Section 35.6 1 99
Comments: The members of this class show only one of the three possible
patterns of expressing arguments, the pattern where the place being searched
is the direct object of the verb; that is, the place cannot be expressed via a
prepositional phrase.
35.5 Rummage Verbs
Class Members: bore, burrow, delve, forage, fumble, grope, leaf, listen, look,
page, paw, poke, rifle, root, rummage, scrabble, scratch, snoop, thumb, tunnel
Properties:
(522) a. * We rummaged the drawer for important documents.
b. We rummaged in the drawer for important documents.
? We rummaged for important documents in the drawer.
c. * We rummaged important documents in the drawer.
Comments: The members of this class show only one of the three possible
patterns of argument expression available to verbs of searching, the pattern
where both arguments are expressed using prepositional phrases. With some
verbs, the order of prepositional phrases in which the prepositional phrase
expressing the object being looked for precedes the prepositional phrase expressing
the location being searched seems more awkward than the reverse
order.
35.6 Ferret Verbs
Class Members: ferret, nose, seek, tease
Properties:
(523) a. * I ferreted the woods for game.
b. * I ferreted for game in the woods.
c. I ferreted the secret out of him.
Comments: The members of this class show only one of the three possible
patterns available to verbs of searching for argument expression, the pattern
where the object being looked for is the direct object of the verb. This subclass
is the only one whose members do not allow the entity being sought to be
expressed in a for prepositional phrase. Unlike the situation with the other
subclasses, one of the source prepositions is preferred as the preposition heading
the locative prepositional phrase.

36 Verbs of Social Interaction
References: Condoravdi ( 1 990), Dong ( 1 970), Dowty ( 1 99 1), Fellbaum
( 1990), Ginzburg ( 1 990), Snell-Homby ( 1 983)
Most of these verbs relate to group activities-activities that inherently
involve more than one participant-and even those verbs that do not inherently
involve a group require more than one participant in the use described here. A
significant number of these verbs relate to fighting; another large group relates
to verbal interactions. When one of these verbs takes a subject that refers to
a single person, then it must take either a direct object (the marry verbs) or a
with phrase (the correspond verbs); it need not take a complement if its subject
is a collective NP. In addition, those verbs that relate to verbal interactions can
take a prepositional phrase describing the content of the communication (They
bargained over the price), while those verbs that relate to fighting can take
prepositional phrases describing the reason for the fight (They fought over the
land). The prepositions most commonly heading such phrases are over and
about; the choice of preposition depends on the verb and the content of the
prepositional phrase itself.
36.1 Correspond Verbs
Class Members: agree, argue, banter, bargain, bicker, brawl, clash, coexist,
collaborate, collide, combat, commiserate, communicate, compete, concur,
confabulate, conflict, consort, cooperate, correspond, dicker, differ, disagree,
dispute, dissent, duel, elope, feud, flirt, haggle, hobnob, jest, joke, joust, mate,
mingle, mix, neck, negotiate, pair, plot, quarrel, quibble, rendezvous, scuffle,
skirmish, spar, spat, spoon, squabble, struggle, tilt, tussle, vie, war, wrangle,
wrestle
Properties:
(524) Brenda bantered with Molly.
(525) Collective NP Subject:
* Brenda bantered.
The committee bantered.
(526) Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. Brenda bantered with Molly.
b. Brenda and Molly bantered.
(527) * Understood Reciprocal Object Alternation:
a. * Brenda bantered Molly.
b. Brenda and Molly bantered:
Section 36.3
(528) * With Preposition Drop Alternation:
a. Brenda bantered with Molly.
b. * Brenda bantered Molly:
(529) Brenda and Molly bantered about the party. (most verbs)
20 1
Comments: The members of this subset of the verbs of social interaction
take a with phrase complement when they do not take a collective NP as
subject. They cannot be used transitively when they do not take a collective
NP as subject. There are significant subclasses dealing with verbal interactions
and fighting. The chitchat verbs (sec. 37.6) behave in most respects like these
verbs, but they have been included among the verbs of communication below to
illustrate that there are some verbs of communication that do not take sentential
complements.
36.2 Marry Verbs
Class Members: court, cuddle, date, divorce, embrace, hug, kiss, marry,
nuzzle, pass, pet
Properties:
(530) * Simple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. * Bill married with Kathy.
b. B ill and Kathy married.
(53 1 ) Understood Reciprocal Object Alternation:
a. Bill married Kathy.
b. Bill and Kathy married.
(532) * With Preposition Drop Alternation:
a. Bill married Kathy.
b. * Bill married with Kathy.
Comments: The members of this subset of the verbs of social interaction are
used transitively when they do not take a collective NP as subject. Unlike the
correspond verbs above, they cannot be used intransitively with a with phrase
when they do not take a collective NP as subject.
36.3 Meet Verbs
Class Members: battle, box, consult, debate, fight, meet, play, visit
Properties:
(533) Brenda met with Molly.
(534) * Brenda met.
The committee met.
202 Section 37
(535) S imple Reciprocal Alternation (intransitive):
a. Brenda met with Molly.
b. Brenda and Molly met.
(536) Understood Reciprocal Object Alternation:
a. Anne met Cathy.
b. Anne and Cathy met.
(537) With Preposition Drop Alternation:
a. Anne met with Cathy.
b. Anne met Cathy.
Comments: These verbs are also related to group activities. They show a
combination of the properties of the correspond and marry verbs discussed
above: they are found both in the intransitive simple reciprocal alternation and
the understood reciprocal object alternation. That is, when the verbs in this
subclass do not take a collective NP as subject, they can be used transitively as
well as intransitively with a with phrase.
37 Verbs of Communication
References: J.L. Austin ( 1 962), Dixon ( 199 1 ) , Fellbaum ( 1990), Kirsner
( 1 972), Ljung ( 1 980), J. McCawley ( 1 977), G. Miller and Johnson-Laird
( 1 976), Mufwene ( 1 978), Munro ( 1982), Snell-Hornby ( 1983), Vendler ( 1 972),
Wierzbicka ( 1 987, 1 988b), Zwicky ( 1 97 1 a, 1 97 1 b)
This section provides an abbreviated treatment of some of the classes of
verbs relating to communication and the transfer of ideas. The reason for this
briefness is that sentential complements will figure prominently in any full
description of the properties of these verbs, but a systematic treatment of such
complements is outside the scope of this book. The verbs included here are those
which show noteworthy properties that do not involve sentential complements;
for example, some of these verbs are found in the dative alternation.
37.1 Verbs of Transfer of a Message
References: Workgroup on Functional Grammar ( 1 98 1 )
Class Members: ask, cite, demonstrate, dictate, explain, explicate, narrate,
?pose, preach, quote, read, recite, relay, show, teach, tell, write
Section 37.2
Properties:
(538) Wanda taught the students.
(539) Dative Alternation (most verbs) :
a. Wanda taught French to the students.
b. Wanda taught the students French.
(540) Wanda taught the students that the earth was round.
203
Comments: These verbs are described by Gropen et al. ( 1 989) as "verbs of
type of communicated message (differentiated by something like ' illocutionary
force ')." As this description makes clear, they differ with respect to the nature of
the message and the way it is communicated. This set of verbs is not treated fully
here, but has been included to exemplify a set of verbs of communication that
may take a to phrase indicating the addressee (goal) of a communication and
that allow the dative alternation (assuming they meet the Latinate restriction on
the dative alternation). Most of these verbs may take sentential complem􀐈nts,
but this aspect of their behavior is not explored here.
37.2 Tell
References: Haile ( 1990)
Class Members: tell (only)
Properties:
(54 1 ) Ellen told a story.
(542) Ellen told a story to Helen.

(548) * Sentential Complement with Goal To Phrase:
* Ellen told to Helen that the party would be tonight.
204
* Ellen told to Helen how to avoid the crowd.
* Ellen told to Helen to come.
(549) * Sentential Complement without Goal Phrase:
* Ellen told that the party would be tonight.
* Ellen told how to avoid the crowd.
* Ellen told to come.
(550) * Ellen told for Helen to <:;orne.
(55 1 ) Direct Speech:
Ellen told me, "Leave the room."
* Ellen told to me, "Leave the room."
(552) Parenthetical Use of the Verb:
The winner, Ellen told me, would be announced tonight.
Section 37.3
* The winner, Ellen told to me, would be announced tonight.
(553) Passive:
I was told that the winner would be announced tonight.
(554) * Impersonal Passive:
* It was told that the winner would be announced tonight.
(555) * Zero-related Nominal:
* a tell
Comments: Although the verb tell is included among the verbs of transfer
of a message above, it is given a fuller treatment in this section. The focus here
is on tell as a simple verb of communication. Its meaning does not include any
further specification, such as a manner or instrument component, unlike that
of the verbs of manner of speaking below, for example. Most of the properties
listed above are further elaborated in Zwicky ( 1 97 1 a).
37.3 Verbs of Manner of Speaking
References: Atkins and B. Levin ( 1 991), Barka1 ( 1 972), Bolinger ( 1 972b),
Duszak ( 1 980), Emonds ( 1 985), G. Lakoff ( 1 970a), B. Levin ( 1 99 1 ), G. Miller

Susan whispered her consent.
(568) ? Cognate Object:
? Susan whispered a piercing whisper.
(569) Zero-related Nominal:
a whisper/give a whisper
Comments: This set of verbs has been referred to as ·􀐉verbs of manner of
speaking," and as this label suggests, they are distinguished from each other by
206 Section 37.4
the manner in which the sound is expressed. In fact, many of these verbs are
also used as verbs of animal sound (cf. sec. 38) and/or verbs of sound emission
(cf. sec. 43.2) if sounds with similar characteristics are associated with animals
and/or inanimate entities. In principle, all verbs listed here could potentially be
found in all three classes, although only a subset of them commonly show one
or both of these other uses. In addition, some of the verbs included here are
also listed under verbs of nonverbal expression (sec. 40.2), as they are probably
basically verbs of nonverbal expression. In fact, even though most of the verbs
of nonverbal expression have not been cross-listed under the verbs of manner
of speaking here, most of those that involve making a sound (and some of the
others, too) can potentially be used as verbs of manner of speaking.
These verbs show an extremely complex set of properties. Most of the properties
given above are drawn from Zwicky ( 1 97 1 a) and are elaborated there.
Zwicky writes that these verbs take cognate objects, but there seem to be
differences of opinion about whether such objects are indeed permitted; it is
also possible that the different verbs in the class might behave differently.
Zwicky points out that these verbs can be used either communicatively or
rioncommunicatively. Certain choices of complements disambiguate the verbs.
For example, the presence of a to phrase forces the communicative interpretation,
while passivization forces the noncommunicative interpretation. A careful
consideration of the communicative/noncommunicative distinction will undoubte<)
ly lead to a more refined analysis of these verbs. The that complements
found with these verbs are understood nonfactively. ·
37.4 Verbs of Instrument of Communication
References: Leitner ( 1 974 ), Marchand ( 1 969), Sehnert and Sharwood-Smith
( 1 973). For more discussion of these verbs see also studies of the dative
alternation (cf. sec. 2. 1 ) .
Class Members: cable, e-mail, fax, modem, netmail, phone, radio, relay,
satellite, semaphore, sign, signal, telephone, telecast, telegraph, telex, wire,
wireless
Properties:
(570) Heather cabled the news.
(57 1 ) Heather cabled Sara.
(572) Dative Alternation:
a. Heather cabled the news to Sara.
b. Heather cabled Sara the news.
(573) * Heather cabled to Sara.
Section 37.5
(574) * Heather cabled the news at Sara.
(575) Heather cabled Sara about the situation.
(576) Sentential Complement with Optional Goal Object:
Heather cabled (Sara) that the party would be tonight.
Heather cabled (Sara) when to send the package.
Heather cabled (Sara) to come.
(577) Sentential Complement with Optional Goal To Phrase:
Heather cabled (to Sara) that the party would be tonight.
Heather cabled (to Sara) when to send the package.
Heather cabled (to Sara) to come.
(578) Heather cabled for Sara to come.
(579) Direct Speech:
Heather cabled (Sara), "Come immediately."
Heather cabled (to Sara), "Come immediately."
(580) Parenthetical Use of the Verb:
207
The winner, Heather cabled (Sara), would be announced tonight.
The winner, Heather cabled (to Sara), would be announced tonight.
(58 1 ) Zero-related Nominal:
a
'
cable (result-some verbs only)
a satellite (instrument)
Comments: Each of these verbs is zero-related to a noun that names an
instrument of communication, although some of them also have zero-related
nominals with a result interpretation (e.g. , cable). They relate to communication
via these instruments of communication. The means of communication need
not involve the use of voice. The verbs in this class are set apart from other verbs
of communication in manifesting the dative alternation (with some exceptions,
which are likely to vary from speaker to speaker). This property suggests that
these verbs might be considered verbs of change of possession like other dative
verbs ( cf. sec. 1 3); this is possible if communication is viewed as the acquisition
of information. The verbs included here have not, however, been cross-listed
under verbs of giving.
37.5 Talk Verbs
Class Members: speak, talk
Properties:
(582) Ellen talked.
208
(583)
(584)

a. Ellen and Helen talked.
b. * Ellen talked Helen.
(59 1) * Wit h Preposition Drop Alternation:
a. Ellen talked with Helen.
b. *Ellen talked Helen.
(592) Zero-related Nominal:
a talk/have a talk
*a speak
Section 37.6
Comments: These verbs have been grouped together here, even though a
more extensive examination of their properties reveals differences between ·
them,. because the meanings of both relate to speaking but do not involve a
means or manner specification. These verbs do not take sentential complements.
They can take a to phrase to express the goal that the communication is directed
to. They can also take a with phrase, which indicates another participant in a
conversation. In contrast, the chitchat verbs below cannot take a to phrase.
37.6 Chitchat Ve rbs
Class Members: argue, chat, chatter, chitchat, confer, converse, gab, gossip,
rap, schmooze, yak
Properties:
(593) Ellen was chitchatting.
Section 37.7

b. * Ellen chitchatted Helen.
(601 ) * With Preposition Drop Alternation:
a. Ellen chitchatted with Helen.
b. * Ellen chitchatted Helen.
209
Comments: Most of these verbs can be used to describe spoken interactions
between two or more participants. These verbs are found with with phrases
but not usually with to phrases. They do not take sentential complements. The
chitchat verbs behave in most respects like the correspond verbs (sec. 36. 1 ),
but they have been included among the verbs of communication to illustrate
that there are some verbs in that class that do not take sentential complements.
37.7 Say Verbs
Class Members: announce, articulate, blab, blurt, claim, confess, confide,
convey, declare, mention, note, obserye, proclaim, propose, recount, reiterate,
relate, remark, repeat, report, reveal, say, state, suggest
Properties:
(602) Ellen said that melons were selling well.
(603) Ellen said to Helen that melons were selling well.

(605) *Dative Alternation:
a. Ellen said something to Helen.
b. *Ellen said Helen something.
(606) *Ellen said to Helen.
(607) *Ellen said about the present conditions.
Comments: Verbs such as these are described as "verbs of communication
of propositions and propositional attitudes" by Gropen et al. (1989). This set of
verbs has been included to exemplify a set of verbs of communication that may
take a to phrase indicating the addressee·(goal) of a communication but that
do not allow the dative alternation. They allow a very limited range of noun
phrases as objects. These verbs may also take finite sentential complements.
Some of these verbs can take other types of sentential complements, but these
possibilities are not explored here. A careful and more extensive study of these
verbs is needed.
37.8 Complain Verbs
Class Members: boast, brag, complain, crab, gripe, grouch, grouse, grumble,
kvetch, object
Properties:
( 608) Ellen complained.
(609) Ellen complained to Helen.

(614) Ellen complained about the situation.
(615) Ellen complained about the situation to Helen.
(616) *Cognate Object:
*Ellen complained a complaint (to Helen).
Section 37.9
( 617) * Ellen complained at Helen.
Ellen grouched at Helen.
(618) Zero-related Nominal (most verbs):
a gripe, a complaint
2 1 1
Comments: These verbs specify the speaker's attitude or feelings toward
what is said. They only take finite sentential complements. Some of these verbs
allow at phrases, as well as to phrases, to express the person the communication .
is directed to; others do not. Some of these verbs have zero-related nominals,
while others have other types of derived nominals; the exception is crab, which
does not have a related nominal.
37.9 Advise Verbs
References: J.L. Austin (1962), J. McCawley (1977), Vendler (1972), Wall
(1968), Wierzbicka ( 1987)

(628) * Zero-related Nominal (most verbs):
* an admonish
2 1 2 Section 38
Comments: These verbs relate to giving advice or warnings. The verbs in this
class are among the verbs in English that allow a PRO-arb object interpretation
when used intransitively. The exception is the verb alert, which requires an
obligatory object.
38 Verbs of Sounds Made by Animals

(632) Reaction Object:
The dog barked a warning.
(633) Resultative Phrase :
The rooster crowed everyone awake.
Comments: These verbs describe the expression of sounds by animals; each
verb describes the sound characteristic of some type of animal. Some of these
.verbs are also used as verbs of sound emission (cf. sec. 43.2) and/or verbs of
manner of speaking (cf. sec. 37.3), if a sound with the same characteristics is
associated with an inanimate entity and/or a person. In principle, all verbs listed
here could potentially be found in all three classes, although only a subset of
them commonly show one or both of those other uses. When some of these
verbs are used as verbs of sound emission they may take directional phrase
complements, but this possibility is not open to them when they are used as
verbs of animal sound.

39 Verbs of Ingesting
References: Brame (not dated), Dixon ( 1 99 1 ), Fellbaum ( 1 990), Fellbaum
and Kegl ( 1 989), G. Miller and Fellbaum ( 1 99 1 ) , Rice ( 1 988), Snell-Hornby
( 1 983 ), Wierzbicka ( 1 982)
The following verb classes relate to the ingestion of food or drink. These
classes of verbs vary as to whether or not they allow the unspecified object
alternation and the conative alternation. In addition, the members of some of
these classes show an intransitive use that resembles the conative construction
but involves the preposition on rather than the typical conative preposition
at; this use of on has been noted in Part I in the discussion of the conative
alternation (sec. 1 .3). Some studies of these verbs in other languages lump
them together with verbs of acquisition of information such as learn, because
the acquisition of information may be viewed as a type of ingesting and because
the subject of verbs in both these classes does not behave like the subject of
most intransitive agentive verbs with respect to causativization.
39.1 Eat Verbs
Class Members: drink, eat (only)
Properties:
(634) Cynthia ate the peach.
(635) Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Cynthia ate the peach.
b. Cynthia ate.
(636) Conative Alternation:
a. Cynthia ate the peach.
b. Cynthia ate at the peach.
(637) * Cynthia ate on the peach.
(638) * Instrument Subject Alternation:
a. Cynthia ate the peach with a fork.
b. * The fork ate the peach.
(639) Resultative Phrase:
Cynthia ate herself sick.
(640) Zero-related Nominal:
a drink/take a drink/have a drink
* an eat/*take an eat/* have an eat
2 14 Section 39.2
Comments: These two verbs are the simple verbs of ingesting: eat involves
ingesting solids and drink liquids. Their meaning does not specify the manner
of ingesting or the meal involved.
39.2 Chew Verbs
Class Members: chew, chomp, crunch, gnaw, lick, munch, nibble, pick, peck,
sip, slurp, suck
Properties:
(641) Cynthia nibbled the carrot.
(642) Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Cynthia nibbled the carrot.
b. Cynthia nibbled.
(643) Conative Alternation:
a. Cynthia nibbled the carrot.
b. Cynthia nibbled at the carrot.
(644) Cynthia nibbled on the carrot.
(645) Zero-related Nominal:
a nibble
Comments: The meaning of these -yerbs involves a specification of the manner
of ingesting. These verbs participate in what appears to be the conative
alternation, although some of them allow both the prepositions at and on, while
others only take the preposition on.
39.3 Gobble Verbs
Class Members: bolt, gobble, gulp, guzzle, quaff, swallow, swig, wolf
Properties:
(646) Cynthia gobbled the pizza.
(647) Cynthia gobbled the pizza down.
(648) * Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Cynthia gobbled the pizza.
b. * Cynthia gobbled.
(649) * Conative Alternation:
a. Cynthia gobbled the pizza.
b. * Cynthia gobbled at/on the pizza.
Section 39.5
(650) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a swallow
2 1 5
Comments: The meaning o f these verbs involves the complete, and usually
speedy, consumption of something. These verbs do not participate in either
the conative alternation or the unspecified object alternation. There may be a
preference for using some of these verbs with the particle down.
39.4 Devour Verbs
Class Members: consume, devour, imbibe, ingest, swill
Properties:
(65 1 ) Cynthia devoured the pizza.
(652) * Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Cynthia devoured the pizza.
b. * Cynthia devoured.
(653) * Conative Alternation:
a. Cynthia devoured the pizza.
b. * Cynthia devoured at the pizza.
(654) * Cynthia devoured on the pizza.
(655) * Zero-related Nominal:
* a devour
Comments: These verbs show a more limited set of properties then some of
the other subclasses of the verbs of ingesting. They must be used transitively
and, unlike the gobble verbs above, they are not found with the particle down.
Like the gobble verbs, they do not allow either the conative alternation or the
unspecified object alternation. Interestingly, these verbs are almost all Latinate.
39.5 Dine Verbs
References: E. V. Clark and H.H. Clark ( 1 979)
Class Members: banquet, breakfast, brunch, dine, feast, graze, lunch,
luncheon, nosh, picnic, snack, sup
Properties:
(656) Cynthia breakfasted.
(657) Cynthia breakfasted on peaches.
216
(658)
(659)
* Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. Cynthia breakfasted.
b. * Cynthia breakfasted peaches.
* Conative Alternation:
a. * Cynthia breakfasted peaches.
b. * Cynthia breakfasted at peaches.
Section 39.6
Comments: These verbs all refer to eating particular meal s, and most of
them are zero-related to nouns that name meals. These verbs cannot be used
transitively. They are not found in the conative alternation with the preposition
at, although they may take on.
39.6 Gorge Verbs
Class Members: exist, feed, flourish, gorge, live, prosper, survive, thrive
Properties:
(660) *Cynthia gorged.
(66 1) Cynthia gorged on peaches.
(662) *Unspecified Object Alternation:
a. * Cynthia gorged.
b. * Cynthia gorged peaches.
(663) *Conative Alternation:
a. * Cynthia gorged peaches.
b. * Cynthia gorged at peaches.
Comments: These verbs are used to describe what a person 's diet consists
of. They pattern almost exactly like the dine verbs above, except that they are
not zero-related to nouns and cannot be used without a prepositional phrase ,
(at least not while maintaining the same sense). These verbs cannot be used
tr ansitively. They are not found in the conative alternation with the preposition
at, although they may take on. All of these verbs, except feed and gorge, are
basically not verbs of eating, but rather verbs of existence; they are cross-listed
(cf. sec. 47).
39.7 Verbs of Feeding
References: Fellbaum (1990)
Class Members: bottlefeed, breastfeed, feed, forcefeed, handfeed, spoonfeed
Properties:
(664) Tere sa bottlefed the baby.
Section 40.1.1
(665) Dative Alternation:
a. Teresa bottlefed soy milk to the baby.
b. Teresa bottlefed the baby soy milk.
(666) ? Teresa bottlefed the baby on/with soy milk.
(667) * Teresa bottlefed soy milk.
217
Comments: The verbs in this set describe causing someone to eat. The
verb feed does not specify a particular means or manner, although the other
verbs, which are compounds with the verb feed as the right-hand member,
do. The acceptability of the use of the prepositions with or on to head a
prepositional phrase specifying the type of food varies with the different verbs;
such prepositional phrases appear to be most acceptable with the verb feed.
40 Verbs Involving the Body
40.1 Verbs of Bodily Processes
References: Dixon ( 1 99 1 ) , Fellbaum ( 1 990), McClure ( 1 990), Rice (1 988),
Sneli-Homby ( 1 983), Thalberg ( 1 972)

(669) ? Cognate Object:
? Paul hiccuped a loud hiccup.
(670) * Paul hiccuped at/on Mary.
(67 1 ) ?? Resultative Phrase:
?? Paul hiccuped himself sick.
(672) Zero-related Nominal:
a hiccup
* give a hiccup (most verbs)
2 1 8 Section 40. 1 .2
Comments: These verbs relate to involuntary bodily processes; that is, processes
that are typically not under the control of the person that experiences
them.
40.1.2 · Breathe Verbs
Class Members: bleed, breathe, cough, cry, dribble, drool, puke, spit, sweat,
vomit, ?weep
Properties:
(673) Paul breathed.
(674) Cognate Object (few verbs) :
Paul breathed a deep breath.
* Paul sweated a cold sweat.
(675) Substance Object (most verbs):
The dragon breathed fire.
(676) Paul breathed on Mary.
(677) * Paul breathed at Mary. (most verbs)
(678) * Resultative Phrase:
* Paul breathed Mary awake.
(679) Zero-related Nominal (most verbs):
a breath/*give a breath
Comments: These verbs also relate to bodily processes. With the exception of
breathe, which can also describe taking air into the body, they relate to emitting
a substance from the body. Most of them take on complements. The emitted
substance may be optionally expressed as the object of the verb; however, few
of these verbs can take cognate objects even though some of them have zerorelated
nominals. Among those that have zero-related nominals, only cough is
found in the light verb construction headed by give, but this might be because
cough is also a verb of nonverbal expression (cf. below).
40.1.3 Exhale Verbs
Class Members: exhale, inhale, perspire
Properties:
(680) Paul exhaled.
(68 1) * Cognate Object:
* Paul exhaled a deep breath.
Section 40.2
(682) * Paul exhaled at Mary.
(683) * Paul exhaled on Mary.
(684) * Zero-related Nominal:
* an exhale
219
Comments: These verbs relate to emitting some substance from the body or
taking some substance into the body. They show a limited set of properties. All
of these verbs are of Latinate origin.
40.2 Verbs of Nonverbal Expression

Class Members: beam, cackle, chortle, chuckle, cough, cry, frown, gape,
gasp, gawk, giggle, glare, glower, goggle, grimace, grin, groan, growl, guffaw,
howl, jeer, laugh, moan, pout, scowl, sigh, simper, smile, smirk, sneeze, snicker,

Paul laughed at the story. (at: in reaction to)
(689) She laughed in/from embarrassment.
(690) Resultative Phrase (most verbs):
Paul laughed himself sick.
The audience laughed the actor off the stage.
(691) Zero-related Nominal (most verbs):
a laugh/give a laugh
Comments: These verbs can be described as verbs of "nonverbal expression."
Most of them involve facial expressions that are associated with a particular
emotion. Although almost all of these verbs have zero-related nominals, some
of them take these nominals as cognate objects more freely than others. Some
of these verbs are used as manner of speaking verbs and have been included in
the list of manner of speaking verbs (sec. 37.3); in principle, all of these verbs
could show properties of manner of speaking verbs. The verbs in this class
220 Section 40.3
often take at phrases; some at phrases seem to indicate the person the action is
directed at, while others seem to indicate what the action is a reaction to. The
verbs vary as to whether or not they allow both types of at phrases.
40.3 Verbs of Gestures/Signs Involving Body Parts
References: Bresnan ( 1 982b), Rice ( 1 988), Ross ( 1 970), Snell-Homby
( 1 983), Thalberg ( 1 977). See Hatcher ( 1 944a, 1 944b) and Junker and Martineau
( 1 987) for discussion of similar phenomena in French and J.S. Levine
( 1 980) for discussion of similar phenomena in Russian.
40.3.1 Wink Verbs
Class Members: blink (eye), clap (hands), nod (head), point (finger), shrug
(shoulders), squint (eyes), wag (tail), wave (hand), wink (eye)
Properties:
(692) Linda winked her eye/*lip/*nose.
(693) Linda winked her/*his eye.

(699) Reaction Object:
Linda winked her agreement.
.(700) Zero-related Nominal:
a wink (of complicity)
give a wink
Comments: These verbs relate to gestures or signs made with specific body
parts. The direct object of these verbs is typically a body part possessed by
the subject of the verb; this object is optionally expressed, and when it is not
Section 40.3.2 221
expressed, it is understood. These verbs are also found with reaction objects.
However, they do not typically take cognate objects, although almost all have
zero-related nominals. These verbs often take at phrase􀍡; some at phrases seem
to describe the person the action is directed at, while others seem to indicate
what the action is a reaction to. The verbs vary as to whether or not they allow
both types of at phrases. A few of these verbs, including point and wave, also
take to phrases.
40.3.2 Crane Verbs
Class Members: arch (back, neck), bare (teeth), bat (eyelashes), beat (feet),
blow (nose), clench (fists), click (heels, tongue), close (eyes), cock (head), crane

* a crane (of the neck)/*give a crane (of the neck)
a shake of the head/give a shake of the head
Comments: These verbs describe gestures or signs made with specific body
parts. The direct object of these verbs is a body part possessed by the subject of
222 Section 40.3 . 3
the verb. Unlike the object of the wink verbs above, this object must be obligatorily
expressed. Given the obligatoriness of the object, it is not unexpected that
crane verbs do not take cognate objects. Many of these verbs are found with at
phrases designating the person the action is directed to or the person/thing the
action is in reaction to. Few of these verbs have zero-related nominals, at least
on the relevant interpretation.
40.3.3 Curtsey Verbs
Class Members: bob, bow, curtsey, genuflect, kneel, salaam, salute
Properties:
(708) The princess curtseyed.
(709) The princess curtseyed to the queen.
(710) * Cognate Object:
* The princess curtseyed a beautiful curtsey.
(7 1 1 ) Reaction Object:
The princess curtseyed her assent.
(7 1 2) Zero-related Nominal:
a curtsey (most verbs)
Comments: The verbs in this class describe signs made with the entire body.
They differ from each other with respect to the movement involved and the
position attained. Unlike the wink and crane verbs above, they do not take a
body part as object. They do not take cognate objects either. Many of these
verbs are found with to phrases designating the person the action is directed
toward. Most of them have zero-related nominals.
40.4 Snooze Verbs
Class Members: catnap, doze, drowse, nap, sleep, slumber, snooze
Properties:
(7 1 3) Gloria snoozed.
{7 14) * Causative Alternations:
a. * The heavy meal snoozed Gloria.
b. Gloria snoozed.
(7 15) * Cognate Object (except sleep):
* Gloria snoozed a light snooze.
(7 1 6) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a snooze
Section 40.6 223
Comments: These verbs describe different types of sleeping. With the exception
of the verb sleep itself, they do not appear to take cognate objects.
Some of the snooze verbs do not have zero-related nominals. The verbs doze
and drowse are found with the particle off, indicating a transition from a state
of being awake to a state of being asleep.
40.5 Flinch Verbs
Class Members: ?balk, cower, cringe, flinch, recoil, shrink, wince
Properties:
(717) Sharon flinched.
(718) Sharon flinched at the sight of the accident.
(719) * Causative Alternations:
a. * The shock flinched Sharon.
b. Sharon flinched.
(720) * Cognate Object:
* Sharon flinched a flinch.
(721) * Reaction Object:
* Sharon flinched her pain.
Comments: These verbs describe body movements that reflect an emotional
or physical reaction. For instance, these movements might be triggered by
fear, dislike, shame, cold, or pain. Flinch verbs do not take objects, whether
cognate objects or reaction objects. The verbs in this class often take at phrases
indicating what triggered the body movement.
40.6 Verbs of Body-Internal States of Existence
References: Snell-Hornby (1983)
Class Members: convulse, cower, quake, quiver, shake, shiver, shudder,
tremble, writhe
Properties:
(722) Sharon shivered.
(723) Sharon shivered from fear.
(724) Sharon shivered at the thought of the cold sea.
(725) * Causative Alternations:
a. Sharon shivered.
b. * The fear shivered Sharon.
224 Section 40.7
Comments: These verbs typically take animate subjects. They describe a
physical state of the subject that typically is a reflex of a particular psychological
or physiological state. (Some of these verbs may have another sense involving
an inanimate subject.) The verbs in this class often take at and ft'om phrases
indicating what the state is in reaction to.
40.7 Suffocate Verbs
Class Members: asphyxiate, choke, drown, ?stifle, suffocate
Properties:
(726) Causative Alternation:
a. The pirates drowned the sailor.

a. The seamonster drowned the sailors.
b. ? Sailors drown easily.
(728) Resultative Phrase (some verbs):
He choked/suffocated to death.
* The sailor asphyxiated/drowned to death.
Comments: These verbs relate to the disruption of breathing; they differ
from each other with respect to means. These verbs are found in the causative
alternation. The verbs asphyxiate, drown, and suffocate are often considered
to either lexicalize or entail death and, consequently, have sometimes been
included among the verbs of killing; they are cross-listed with the poison verbs
(sec. 42.2). These three verbs, unlike the other verbs in the class, do not occur
with resultative phrases.
40.8 Verbs of Bodily State and Damage to the Body
40.8.1 Pain Verbs
References: Campbell and Martin ( 1 989), Deane ( 1 984), Dixon ( 1991),
Hatcher ( 195 1), Martin ( 1 99 1 ) , Snell-Homby ( 1 983), Wierzbicka ( 1 980)

Properties:
(729) My eyes are itching (me).
(730) * My eyes are itching my brother.
(73 1 ) * Cognate Object:
* My eyes are itching an intense itch.
Section 40.8.3 225
(732) My eyes are itching from the smoke.
(733) * Passive:
* I am being itched by my eyes.
Comments: These verbs of bodily state can be used either transitively or
intransitively. The subject of these verbs is a body part whose possessor experiences
the state. When they are used transitively, the object is the experiencer of
the state and, therefore, Understood as the possessor of the body part expressed
in subject position.
·
40.8.2 Tingle Verbs
References: Campbell and Martin ( 1 989), Deane (1984), Hatcher ( 1 95 1 ),
Wierzbicka ( 1980)
Class Members: (mouth) burn, hum, (head, heart) pound, prickle, (lips)
'pucker, (head) reel, (eyes) smart, (head) spin, (head) split, sting, (head) swim,
throb, (throat) tickle, tingle

(734) My heart is pounding.
(735) * My heart is pounding me.
(736) * My heart is pounding my brother.
(737) * Cognate Object:
* My heart is pounding an intense pound.
(738) My heart is pounding from fear.
Comments: These verbs of bodily state are only used intransitively. Their
subject is a body part whose possessor experiences the state. The subject does
not receive an agent or cause interpretation. Some of these verbs have other,
more basic senses and are cross-listed; some are also intransitive verbs of
manner of motion (swim, spin), while others are drawn from various classes of
transitive verbs that take agentive subjects.
40.8.3 Hurt Verbs
References: Abney ( 1 987), Junker and Martineau (1987)
Class Members: bark (shin), bite (lip), bump, burn, break, bruise, chip
(tooth), cut, fracture, hurt, injure, nick (chin, leg), prick (finger), pull (muscle),
rupture, scald, scratch (chin), skin (knee), split (lip), sprain (ankle, back, knee,
wrist), strain, stub (toe), turn (ankle), twist {ankle)
226 Section 40.8.4
(739) Tessa sprained her ankle.
(740) * Tessa sprained Mary 's ankle. (on a non-agentive interpretation)
(741 ) * Cognate Object:
* Tessa sprained a sprain.
(742) * Passive:
* Heri ankle was sprained (by Tessai).
* Tessa's ankle was sprained when she tripped over the rug.
(743) Unintentional interpretation available:
a. Reflexive Object (some verbs):

b. Body-Part Object:
Tessa hurt her ankle.
Tessa sprained her ankle.
(744) * Understood Reflexive Object Alternation:
a. Tessa cut herself.
b. * Tessa cut.
(745) * Understood Body-Part Object Alternation:
a. Tessa sprained her ankle.
b. * Tessa sprained.
(746) Adjectival Passive Participle:
a sprained ankle
(747) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs) :
a sprain
Comments: These verbs relate to the occurrence of damage to the body
through a process that is not under control of the person that suffers the damage.
Although some of these verbs may take agentive subjects, the subject does not
receive an agentive interpretation on the use considered here. The subject
involuntarily injures himself or herself and does not intentionally inflict an
injury on himself or herself. These verbs resemble the crane verbs above in
taking body-part objects that are possessed by the subject and in often being
restricted to a few specific body parts as objects. Although these verbs are not
found in the verbal passive, some of them may be used in the adjectival passive.
40.8.4 Verbs of Change of Bodily State
Class Members: blanch, faint, sicken, ,swoon
Section 4 1 .l.l
Properties:
(748) Sharon fainted.
(749) Sharon fainted from hunger.
(750) Sharon fainted at the sight of the accident.
(751) * Causative Alternations:
a. * Hunger fainted Sharon.
b. Sharon fainted.
(752) * Cognate Object:
* Sharon fainted a faint.
227
Comments: These verbs describe changes in the states of humans, and hence
take an animate subject.

228 Section 41.1.2
Comments: These verbs relate to taking care of or grooming the whole body.

when they are used intransitively, the action is understood to be directed at the
subject.
41.1.2 Groom Verbs
Class Members: curry, groom
Properties:
(757) Sheila groomed the horse.
(758) * Understood Reflexive Object Alternation:
a. * The horse groomed itself.
b. * The horse groomed.

body, but they always refer to actions performed on another individual. They
are not used intransitively, nor are they found with Xself as object.
41.2 Verbs of Caring for a Specific Body Part
41.2.1 Floss Verbs
Class Members: brush (teeth), floss (teeth), shave (beard, legs), wash (hands,
face)

b. I flossed.
Comments: These verbs relate to taking care of or grooming a part of the
body. They cannot be found with Xself as object, but they may be fo und with
the appropriate body part as object. When these verbs are used intransitively,
the body part that would typically be the object of the verb is understood as the
object. These verbs are not found in the understood reflexive object alternation.
Section 4 1 . 3.2 229
41.2.2 Braid Verbs
Class Members: bob (hair), braid (hair), brush (hair), clip (nails), coldcream
(face), comb (hair), condition (hair), crimp (hair), crop (hair), curl (hair), cut
(hair), dye (hair), file (nails), henna (hair), lather (hair, body), manicure (nails),
part (hair), perm (hair), plait (hair), pluck (eyebrows), powder (face, nose), rinse
(hair, mouth), rouge (cheeks, face), set (hair), shampoo (hair), soap (hands,

Properties:
(763) Celia brushed the baby's hair.
(764) Celia brushed her hair.
(765) * Understood Body-Part Object Alternation:
a. Celia brushed her hair.
b. * Celia brushed.
(766) * Understood Reflexive Object Alternation:
a. * Celia brushed herself.
b. * Celia brushed.
Comments: These verbs relate to taking care of or grooming a part of the
body. With a few exceptions (e.g., to soap oneself), these verbs do not allow
Xself as object, but they may be found with the appropriate body part as object.
Unlike the floss verbs above, these verbs cannot be used intransitively.
41.3 Verbs of Dressing
41.3.1 Simple Verbs of Dressing
Class Members: don, doff, wear
Properties:
(767) She always wore purple dresses.
(768) * Understood Reflexive Object Alternation :
a . * She always wore herself (in purple).
b. * She always wore.
Comments: These verbs relate to wearing, putting on, or taking off clothes.
41.3.2 Verbs of Dressing Well
Class Members: doll, dress, spruce, tog
230
Properties:
(769) She spruced herself up before the job interview.
(770) She spruced up before the job interview.
(77 1 ) * She spruced (herself) before the job interview.
(772) Adjectival Passive:
She was all spruced up for the job interview.
Section 4 1 .3.3
Comments: These verbs relate to dressing well. They must occur with the
particle up. It is likely that when these verbs are found in the passive participle
form, they are being used as adjectival, rather than verbal, passives.
41.3.3 Verbs of Being Dressed
Class Members: attire, clad, garb, robe
Properties:
(773) She was always clad in black.
(774) * Her stepmother always clad her in black.
(775) * Understood Reflexive Object Alternation:
a. * She always clad herself in black.
b. * She always clad in black.
Comments: These verbs of dressing usually occur in the passive participle
form to describe the state of being dressed. This form shows the hallmarks of
being an adjectival, rather than a verbal, passive participle.

· (78 1 ) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a murder
* an assassinate
23 1
Comments: The verbs in this class all describe killing. The verb kill is the
class member with the least specific meaning: it lexicalizes nothing about the
specific means, manner, or purpose involved in bringing about death; it also
differs from the other class members in its behavior. Unlike kill, the other verbs
in this class lexicalize something about the purpose or manner of killing. None
of the verbs in this class lexicalizes a means component; that is, none provides
any information about how the killing came about. This property sets these
verbs apart from the poison verbs below, which lexicalize a means, but not a
result.
Few members of this class of verbs appear to be able to take instrumental
phrases headed by the preposition with. Fewer still allow instrumental subjects;
their absence might reflect the fact that many of the allowable instruments are
merely so-called "enabling" or "facilitating" instruments. The verb kill itself
allows the widest range of instruments. In fact, it generally allows a wider range
of behavior than some of the other class members; for example, it is also found
in the resultative construction.
The verb kill has received substantially more attention than most of the other
members of this class; however, this attention has been directed at it not in
relation to its membership in the class of verbs of killing, but rather in relation
to issues concerning the nature of semantic and syntactic representations.
232 Section 42.2
Specifically, this verb has figured prominently in discussions of the pros and
cons of predicate decomposition. The question that has been frequently asked is
whether kill can be given a predicate decomposition along the lines of "cause to
die." There is a large literature on this question; some representative and central
works are inCluded in the references listed above, which, with few exceptions,
focus on the verb kill. Additional discussion of the predicate decomposition issue
will be found in many of the references listed under Causative Alternations
(sec. 1 .1.2), since the causative/inchoative verbs also play an important part in
this debate.
42.2 Poison Verbs
References: Carter ( 1976, 1988), Dixon (1991)
Class Members: asphyxiate, crucify, drown, electrocute, garrotte, hang,
knife, poison, shoot, smother, stab, strangle, suffocate
Properties:
(782) The witch poisoned Snow White.
(783) * Causative Alternations (except asphyxiate, drown, suffocate):
a. The witch poisoned Snow White.
b. * Snow White poisoned.
(784) * Middle Alternation:
a. The witch poisoned the children.
b. * Children poison easily.
(785) Resultative Phrase (some verbs):
The Boston Strangler strangled his victims to death.
?? The weak swimmer was drowned to death.
(786) * Zero-related Nominal:
* a drown (result; cf. a drowning)
Comments: The verbs in this class relate to actions which can be ways of
killing. Thus they each lexicalize a means component, and it is this means which
differentiates among them. In principle, as means verbs, these verbs need not
entail that the action they denote results in death; however, some of them do
appear to have this entailment. Their differing behavior in this respect probably
reflects our conception of how effective the means involved is in causing death.
Therefore, although the entailment of death suggests that some of the verbs in
this class could have been included among the murder verbs above, they have
been kept distinct since, strictly speaking, they lexicalize a means. This same
variation in behavior is probably responsible for the fact that some of these
Section 43. 1 233
verbs are more likely than others to be found with resultative phrases such as
to death.
Few members of this class are found with instrumental phrases, probably
because they already lexicalize a means. Those that are in fact found with
an instrumental phrase typically take what might be described as a "cognate"
instrumental phrase (e.g., poison with rat poison) or an instrumental phrase
involving a hyponym of poison. Fewer still allow instrumental subjects; their
absence might reflect the fact that most of the allowable instruments are merely
so-called "enabling" or "facilitating" instruments.
Some of these verbs are not exclusively verbs of killing, since they describe
actions that have death as only one of their possible results. These include the
verb shoot, which is cross-listed under the swat verbs (sec. 1 8.2), as well as
the verbs asphyxiate, drown, and suffocate, which are cross-listed under the
suffocate verbs (sec. 40.7) and are the only verbs in the poison class to show
one of the causative alternations.
43 Verbs of Emission
References: Brekke ( 1 988), B. Levin ( 1 99 1 ), B . Levin and Rappaport ( 1 988),
B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1992b), Merlan ( 1 985), Perlmutter ( 1 978),
Pinker ( 1 989), Salkoff ( 1 983), Zoeppritz ( 1 97 1 )
The verbs in this class involve the emission of a stimulus or substance that
is particular to some entity, and consequently, these verbs take a very limited
range of subjects. For instance, typically brooks babble and the wind whistles,
but not vice versa. There is a sense in which verbs in this class describe intrinsic
properties of their subjects. In this respect, these verbs resemble the verbs of
entity-specific modes of being (cf. sec. 47.2). Verbs of emission typically take
inanimate subjects.
43.1 Verbs of Light Emission
Class Members: beam, blink, bum, blaze, flame, flare, flash, flicker, glare,
gleam, glimmer, glint, glisten, glitter, glow, incandesce, scintillate, shimmer,
shine, sparkle, twinkle
Properties:
(787) The jewel sparkled.
234 Section 43.2
(788) Locative Alternation:
a. Jewels sparkled on the crown.
b. The crown sparkled with jewels.
(789) Locative Inversion:
a. A magnificent diamond sparkled on his fi nger.
b. On his finger .sparkled a magnificent diamond.
(790) There-Insertion:
a. A magnificent diamond sparkled on his finger.
b. On his finger there sparkled a magnificent diamond.
(791) Causative Alternation (some verbs):
a. The stagehand flashed the lights.
The lights flashed.
b. * The stagehand sparkled the lights.
The lights sparkled.
(792) a sparkling jewel
(793) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* a sparkled jewel
(794) -er Nominal:
sparkler
(795) Zero-related Nominal:
a sparkle (of excitement)
Comments: The members of this subset relate to the emission of light. They
show the intransitive swarm form of the locative alternation (cf. sec. 2.3.4).
Like other verbs found in the locative alternation, they show a "holistic" interpretation
in the with variant. These·verbs are also found in the locative inversion ·
and there-insertion constructions. Some verbs of light emission clearly allow
a transitive use with a causative interpretation. A variety of factors determine
whether the causative use is available, so that it is possible that in the right
circumstances additional members of this class could show such a use. For
this reason, this set of verbs has not been separated into two subsets on the
basis of the availability of a causative transitive use. The verbs scintillate and
incandesce are more restricted in their behavior than the other verbs in this
class; interestingly, these are the only two clearly Latinate members of the set.
43.2 Verbs of Sound Emission

(803) a squeaking door
(804) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* a squeaked door
(805) -er Nominal:
a squeaker
236 Section 43.3
(806) Zero-related Nominal:
the squeak (of unoiled hinges)
Comments: The members of this subset of the verbs of emission relate to
the emission of sounds. Many of these verbs also figure among the verbs of
manner of speaking (sec. 37.3) and/or the verbs of sounds made by animals
(sec. 38). Some of these verbs allow an object; with some verbs, such as toll or
chime, this object may express a time. Some members of this class are found
with directional phrases; generally, this option is only allowed if the sound is a
necessary concomitant of the motion of some entity (*Shelly whistled down the
street/The train whistled into the station). Verbs of sound emission show the
intransitive swarm form of the locative alternation (cf. sec. 2.3.4). Like other
verbs found in the locative alternation, they show a "holistic" interpretation in
the with variant. Some of these verbs are also found in the locative inversion and
there-insertion constructions. Some verbs of sound emission allow a transitive
use with a causative interpretation. A variety of factors determine whether the
causative use is available, so that it is possible that in the right circumstances
more members of the set could show such a use. For this reason, this set of
verbs has not been separated into two subsets on the basis of the availability of
a causative transitive use.
43.3 Verbs of Smell Emission
References: Ljung ( 1 980), Quirk ( 1 970)
Class Members: reek, smell, stink
Properties:
(807) The onions reeked.
(808) Locative Alternation:
a. The onions reeked (??in the room).
b. The room reeked (of onions).
( 809) * Causative Alternations:
a. * Kelly reeked the onions.
b. The onions reeked.
(810) Zero-related Nominal:
a reek (of onions)
Comments: These verbs relate to the emission of smells. The set of verbs of
smell emission is much smaller than the other subsets of the verbs of emission.
These verbs also show a much more limited range of properties. Although
they allow both the emitter of the smell and the location of the smell to tum
Section 43.4 237
up as their subject, as in the intransitive form of the locative alternation, with
these verbs the alternation does not show all the hallmarks of the locative
alternation, and may in fact be a different alternation. More specifically, when
these verbs express the location of the smell as the subject, the emitter of the
smell is expressed in an of phrase, in contrast to the with phrase found with the
analogous variant of the other types of verbs of emission. However, when the
subject of the verb is the emitter of the smell, a co-occurring locative phrase
seems awkward; this is not the case with other subclasses of verbs of emission.






43.4 Verbs of Substance Emission
References: Duszak (1980), B . Levin (1991), Pinker (1989), Snell-Hornby
(1983)
Class Members: belch, bleed, bubble, dribble, drip, drool, emanate, exude,
foam, gush, leak, ooze, pour, puff, radiate, seep, shed, slop, spew, spill, spout,
sprout, spurt, squirt, steam, stream, sweat
Properties:
(811) The fountain gushed:
(812) The well gushed oil.
(813) Causative Alternation (some verbs):
a. * I gushed the fountain.
The fountain gushed.
b. I bled him.
He bled.

(814) Substance/Source Alternation:
a. The well gushed oil.
b. Oil gushed from the well.
(815) Locative Alternation (some verbs) :
a. Water gushed through the streets.
b. The streets gushed with water.
(816) Locative Inversion (some verbs) :
a. A fragrant stew bubbled over the fire.
b. Over the fire bubbled a fragrant stew.
(817) There-Insertion (some verbs):
a. A fragrant stew bubbled over the fire.
b. Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew.
(818) a gushing fountain

* a gushed fountain
(820) -er Nominal:
a gusher
(82 1 ) ·Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a gush (of water)
Section 43.4
Comments: The members of this subset of the verbs of emission relate to the
emission of substances from something (the emitter); there is a sense in which
the emitter can be viewed as a source, as reflected in one of the possible expressions
of the arguments of these verbs. The verbs of substance emission differ
from the other verbs of emission in showing more options for expressing their
arguments. Like other verbs of emission, these verbs take the emitter/source
as subject; but unlike other verbs of emission, they may optionally express the
substance emitted as direct object. These verbs also are used intransitively with
the substance emitted as subject and the emitter/source expressed via a from
phrase, giving rise to their participation in the substance/source alternation.
Some of them can be viewed as describing entity-specific modes of being and
are cross-listed under the verbs of existence (sec. 47.2).
Some members of this class show the intransitive swarm form of the locative
alternation (cf. sec. 2.3.4). These verbs, like other verbs found in the locative
alternation, show a "holistic" interpretation in the with variant. Verbs of substance
emission seem to participate in the there-insertion and locative inversion
constructions less readily than some of the other types of verbs of emission.
Some members of this subset of the verbs of emission allow a transitive use
with a causative interpretation, in which an agent causes some entity (the direct
object) to emit a substance. A variety of factors determine whether the causative
use is available, so that it is possible that under the right circumstances more
members of the set could show such a use. For this reason, this set of verbs has
not been separated into two subsets on the basis of the availability of a causative
transitive use. Some of these verbs also have a transitive use which involves an
agent causing a substance to be emitted from the entity (e.g. , spew and squirt);
that is, in this use the substance, rather than the emitter,
'
is the object. Verbs
with this use are cross-listed under the pour verbs (sec. 9.5) and the spray/load
verbs (sec. 9.7).

44 Destroy Verbs
References: Dixon ( 1 99 1 ), Jackendoff ( 1 990b)
Class Members: annihilate, blitz, decimate, demolish, destroy, devastate,
exterminate, extirpate, obliterate, ravage, raze, ruin, waste, wreck
Properties:
(822) The Romans destroyed the city.
(823) * Causative Alternations:
a. The Romans destroyed the city.
b. * The city destroyed.
(824) * Middle Alternation:
a. The Romans destroyed the city.
b. * Cities destroy easily.
(825) * Material/Product Alternation (transitive):
a. * The Romans destroyed the city into ruins.
b. * The Romans destroyed ruins from the city.
(826) * Total Transformation Alternation:
a. * The Romans destroyed the city into a ruin.
b. * The Romans destroyed the city from a capital into a ruin.
(827) Instrument Subject Alternation:
a. The builders destroyed the warehouse with explosives.
b. The explosives destroyed the warehouse.
(828) * Conative Alternation:
a. The builders destroyed the warehouse.
b. * The builders destroyed at the warehouse.
(829) * Resultative Phrase:
* The builders destroyed the warehouse flat.
* The builders destroyed the warehouse to smithereens.
(830) * Zero-related Nominal:
* a destroy
Comments: These verbs relate to the total destruction of entities. In some
respects, they might seem similar to the break verbs (cf. sec. 45. 1 ) , which
also appear to describe the destruction of entities; but the break verbs describe
specifics of the resulting physical state of an entity (e.g., whether something is
broken, splintered, cracked, and so on) rather than simply describing the fact
that it is totally destroyed. The destroy verbs also differ from the break verbs
240 Section 45
in not being found in the causative/inchoative alternation, nor, for that matter,
in any of the other causative alternations.
Jackendoff ( 1 990b) points out that the destroy verbs could be viewed as
verbs of creation, since the destruction of an entity can result in the creation of
another; however, these verbs cannot express a created "product." Jackendoff
proposes that this property arises because destroy verbs "totally incorporate
the goal" (p. 1 1 7); that is, they describe some facet of the resulting state
of destruction. These verbs are further distinguished from verbs of creation
in not being found in either the material/product or the total transformation
alternations. Jackendoff's observation may also figure in an explanation of
why these verbs are not found in the resu1tative construction, another property
that distinguishes them from the break verbs.

The verb classes in this section all relate to changes of state. Several subsets of
this class that have been singled out in other studies, or that show distinguishing
properties, are treated separately. However, subsection 45.4, "Other Alternating
Section 45. 1 24 1
Verbs of Change of State," provides a general treatment of the properties of
this class of verbs as a whole.
45.1 Break Verbs
References: Brousseau and Ritter ( 199 1), Dixon ( 1 99 1 ), Fillmore ( 1 967,

snap, splinter, split, tear
Properties:

a. Tony broke the window.
b. The window broke.
(833) Middle Alternation:

b. Tony broke her arm.
(838) Unintentional interpretation available (some verbs):
a. Reflexive Object:
* Tony broke himself.
b. Body-Part Object:
Tony broke his finger.
242 Section 45.2
(839) Resultative Phrase:
Tony broke the piggy bank open.
Tony broke the glass to pieces.
(840) Zero-related Nominal:
a break
a break in the window
* the break of a window
Comments: These verbs refer to actions that bring about a change in the
"material integrity" of some entity (Hale and Keyser (1987)). They are often
contrasted with the cut verbs ( cf. sec. 21.1 ), which also involve a change in
"material integrity;" but the break verbs, unlike the cut verbs, are pure verbs
of change of state, and their meaning, unlike that of the cut verbs, provides
no information about how the change of state came about. The most widely
cited property of the break verbs, and one that distinguishes them from the cut
verbs, is their ability to tum up in the causative/inchoative alternation. Both
types of verbs, however, are found in the middle alternation. Some of the break
verbs, like the cut. verbs, allow unintentional, as well as intentional, action
interpretations with body-part objects; some of these verbs are also listed as
hurt verbs (sec. 40.8.3). However, unlike the cut verbs, they do not allow this
interpretation with reflexive objects; this property may be related to the fact
that the break verbs also differ from the cut verbs in not allowing body-part
possessor ascension.
Not all the break verbs have zero-related nominals. When they do, the
nominals describe the result of the action named by the verb. This interpretation
is also associated with nominals zero-related to the cut verbs.
45.2 Bend Verbs
Class Members: bend, crease, crinkle, crumple, fold, rumple, wrinkle

243
Comments: Unlike the break verbs above, the bend verbs relate to a change
in the shape of an entity that does not disrupt its material integrity. These verbs
show the same properties as the break verbs, except that they name reversible
actions; thus one could "unbend" something but not "unbreak" it. Not all these
verbs have zero-related nominals; when they do, the nominals describe the
result of the action named by the verb.

Comments: These verbs describe different ways of cooking food. Many of
these verbs show properties of both change of state verbs and the preparetype
(or sometimes the build-type) verbs of creation and transformation; they
have been cross-listed (sec. 26. 1 , 26.3). That is, in addition to the properties
illustrated in this section, they participate in the benefactive, the unspecified
object, and. the material/product alternations. These properties are not listed
here, since they are associated with this other class membership. Other verbs
of cooking simply describe the cooking process and are not also used as verbs
of creation and transformation; these verbs do not easily allow the benefactive,
unspecified object, or material/product alternations.
Some of the verbs listed above have been included even though they do
not seem to be found in the causative/inchoative alternation (e.g. , plank and
shirr); however, some verbs that might appear to resist the inchoative use can
show this use in the progressive. The verbs cook, bake, boil, and fry-those
verbs which describe the basic methods of cooking-are the ones that show
the widest range of properties.

Section 45.5
Comments: This subsection includes a variety of verbs that relate to externally
.caused changes of state. Many of these chl).nges of state involve changes
of physical state. Many of these verbs are de-adjectival; as noted in Dixon
( 1 982b), dimensional and physical property adjectives often give rise to such
verbs, while human propensity adjectives (e.g., bold, proud, modest) do not.
The most cited property of these verbs is their ability to participate in the
causative/inchoative alternation. They also permit instrument subjects. These
verbs differ from verbs of existence and appearance in not showing certain
alternations that are typically restricted to intransitive verbs: the swarm-type
locative alternation, locative inversion, and there-insertion (unless they also
permit a verb of appearance or existence sense). This behavior appears to be
characteristic of verbs of change of state in general, although it has not been
illustrated with the other subclasses of those verbs here.
45.5 Verbs of Entity-Specific Change of State
Class Members: blister, bloom, blossom, burn, corrode, decay, deteriorate,
erode, ferment, flower, germinate, molder, molt, rot, rust, sprout, stagnate,
swell, tarnish, wilt, wither
Section 45.6
Properties:
(868) The roses bloomed.
(869) * Causative Alternations:
a. * The sun bloomed the roses.
b. The roses bloomed.
(870) * Cognate Object: .
* The roses bloomed a blossom.
(87 1 ) Adjectival Perfect Participle (some verbs):
sprouted wheat
247
Comments: These· verbs describe changes of state that are specific to particular
entities. That is, these verbs impose very narrow selectional restrictions on
their arguments. For example, silver and some other metals tarnish, flowers and
plants wilt, and so on. The changes of state these verbs describe often cannot
be directly caused, but rather are inherent to the entities that undergo them. In
contrast, the alternating verbs of change of state of sees. 45. 1-45.4 describe
changes that can be brought about externally by an agent. A few of the verbs
listed here describe changes of state that can be brought about either through
inherent properties of the entity undergoing the change of state or by an external
cause; these verbs are cross-listed under other alternating verbs of change of
state (sec. 45.4). Usually such verbs show a causative form only with a very
narrow range of causers. Some of the verbs in this class, such as blossom and
burn, allow both an entity-specific change of state use and an entity-specific
mode of being use; these verbs are also cross-listed (cf. sec. 47.2).
45.6 Verbs of Calibratable Changes of State
Class Members: appreciate, balloon, climb, decline, decrease, depreciate,
differ, diminish, drop, fall, fluctuate, gain, grow, increase, jump, ?mushroom,
plummet, plunge, rocket, rise, skyrocket, soar, surge, tumble, vary
Properties:
(872) The temperature soared.
(873) Possessor Subject Possessor-Attribute Factoring Alternation (intransitive):
a. The price of oil soared.
b. Oil soared in price.
(874) * Causative Alternations:
a. The temperature soared.
b. * The heat soared the temperature.
248
(875) * There-Insertion:
a. Oil soared in price.
b. * There soared oil in price.
(876) * Locative Inversion:
a. Oil soared in price.
b. * In price soared oil.
(877) * Cognate Object:
* Oil soared a soar.
(878) soaring temperatures
(879) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* soared prices
Section 46
Comments: These verbs describe positive or negative changes along a scale.
They involve entities that themselves have a measurable attribute. The change
can be predicated directly of the attribute (i.e., the attribute is the subject) or
the change can be predicated of the entity possessing the attribute (i.e., the
entity itself is the subject). When the attribute is the subject, the possessor of
the attribute is expressed as a genitive modifier, but when the possessor is the
subject, the attribute is expressed in a prepositional phrase.
46 Lodge Verbs
Class Members: bivouac, board, camp, dwell, live, lodge, reside, settle,
shelter, stop, stay
Properties:
(880) Cornelia lodged with the Stevensons.
(881) Cornelia lodged at Mrs. Parker's.
(882) Cornelia lodged in the new boarding house.
(883) * There-Insertion:
a. An old woman lodged at Mrs. Parker's.
b. * There lodged an old woman at Mrs. Parker's.
(884) * Locative Inversion:

b. * At Mrs. Parker's lodged an old woman.
Section 47 . I
(885) * Locative Alternation:

b. * These abandoned buildings lodged with squatters.
(886) Causative Alternation (some verbs):
a. The soldiers lodged in the schoolhouse.
The army lodged the soldiers in the schoolhouse.
b. An old woman lived in the forest.
* The king lived an old woman in the forest.
(887) * Adjectival Passive/Perfect Participle:
* a lodged person
(888) -er Nominal (some verbs):
a lodger
249
Comments: These verbs are used to describe one's living situation. In the
sense intended here, they involve protagonist control. However, some of these
verbs can be used as verbs of existence-asserting little more than existence at
a location-and are cross-listed (sec. 47). Although some lodge verbs are found
in there-insertion or locative inversion contexts, this possibility arises only with
those verbs that are also verbs of exister.tce and can probably be attributed to
the availability of this additional sense. Some of the verbs in this class also
allow a transitive causative use.
47 Verbs of Existence
47.1 Exist Verbs
References: Firbas ( 1 966), Kimball ( 1973b ), B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav
( 1 992b). For discussion of the verb lurk, see Harnish ( 1 975) and Sobin ( 1 976).
See also references under There-Insertion and Locative Inversion (sec. 6).
Class Members: coexist, ?correspond, ?depend, dwell, endure, exist, extend,
flourish, languish, linger, live, loom, lurk, overspread, persist, predominate,
prevail , prosper, remain, reside, shelter, stay, survive, thrive, tower, wait

a. A solution to this problem exists.
b. There exists a solution to this problem.
(89 1 ) Locative Inversion:
a. An old woman languished in the forest.
b. In the forest languished an old woman.
(892) * Locative Alternation:
a. A crowd of people remained in the square.
b. * The square remained with a crowd of people.
(893) * Causative Alternations:
a. A solution to this problem exists.
b. * The famous mathematician existed a solution to the problem.
(894) the existing solution
(895) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* an existed solution
Comments: These verbs relate to the existence of an entity at some location.
Some of them require a locative prepositional phrase complement. These verbs
do not impose restrictions on the argument whose existence they assert that
are as specific as those imposed by verbs of entity-specific modes of being.
Unlike the verbs of entity-specific modes of being, exist verbs are not found in
the locative alternation. However, these verbs do figure among the prototypical
locative inversion and there-insertion verbs. Some of them are basically lodge
verbs (cf. above). Other verbs in this class have an extended use as gorge verbs
and are cross-listed (sec. 39.6).
47.2 Verbs of Entity-Specific Modes of Being
Class· Members: billow, bloom, blossom, blow, breathe, bristle, bulge, bum,
cascade, corrode, decay, decompose, effervesce, erode, ferment, fester, fizz,
flow, flower, foam, froth, germinate, grow, molt, propagate, rage, ripple, roil, rot,
rust, seethe, smoke, smolder, spread, sprout, stagnate, stream, sweep, tarnish,
trickle, wilt, wither

Section 47. 3
(898) Locative Inversion (some verbs):
a. A fire raged all through the mountains.
b. All through the mountains raged a fire.
(899) Locative Alternation (some verbs):
a. Roses flowered in the garden.
b. The garden flowered with roses.
(900) * Causative Alternations (with a few exceptions):
a. A fire raged over the fields.
b. * The farmers raged a fire over the fields.
(90 1) a raging fire
(902) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* a raged fire
{903) * -er Nominal:
* a rager, *a foamer
25 1
Comments: Each of these verbs describes a state of existence that is typical
of certain entities, and concomitantly, each of them occurs with a very limited
set of subjects. In this respect, these verbs are like the verbs of emission. Some
of these verbs can also be used as verbs of entity-specific change of state (sec.
45.5); they can describe an entity coming to be in a particular state of existence.
47.3 Verbs of Modes of Being Involving Motion
References: Jackendoff ( 1 990b)
Class Members: bob, bow, creep, dance, drift, eddy, flap, float, flutter, hover,
jiggle, joggle, oscillate, pulsate, quake, quiver, revolve, rock, rotate, shake, stir,
sway, swirl, teeter, throb, totter, tremble, undulate, vibrate, waft, wave, waver,
wiggle, wobble, writhe
Properties:
(904) A large flag fluttered.
(905) A large flag fluttered over the fort.
(906) * Locative Alternation:
a. Many flags fluttered over the fort.
b. * The fort fluttered with many flags.
(907) There-Insertion (some verbs):
a. A large flag fluttered over the fort.
b. Over the fort there fluttered a .large flag.
252 Section 47.4
(908) Locative Inversion (some verbs) :
a. A large flag fluttered over the fort.
b. Over the fmt fluttered a large flag.
(909) · Causative Alternation (some verbs) :
a. The tree trembled.
* The foresters trembled the tree.
b. The flag waved.
The patriots waved the flag.
(9 10) a trembling tree, a fluttering flag
(91 1 ) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* a trembled tree
Comments: These verbs describe states of existence of inanimate entities
that involve types of motion typical of these entities. That is, a type of motion
characterizes the existence of these entities. Reflecting this property, these
verbs take a very limited range of subjects. Some of them can also be used
with animate subjects as verbs of body-internal movement; these verbs are
cross-listed (sec. 49). A few of the verbs included in this section can be used
transitively to describe causing an entity to be in the state of existence named
by the verb.
47.4 Verbs of Sound Existence
Class Members: ?din, echo, resonate, resound, reverberate, sound
Properties:
(91 2) The voices echoed (through the hall).
(9 1 3 ) Locative Alternation:
a. The voices echoed in the hall.
b. The hall is echoing with voices.
(9 1 4) There-Insertion:
a. A loud cry echoed through the hall.
b. Through the hall there echoed a loud cry.
(9 15) Locative Inversion:
a. A loud cry echoed through the hall.
b. Through the hall echoed a loud cry.
(916) * Causative Alternations:
a. The music echoed.
b. * The magician echoed the music.
Section 47.5. 1
(917) * an echoing voice
(918) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* an echoed voice
·
(919) * -er Nominal:
*an echoer
253
Comments: These verbs are often included among the verbs of sound emission
(cf. sec. 43.2), but they do not actually seem to belong to this class. Rather
than describing the emission of a particular sound, they describe the existence
of a sound, although they are vague as to the exact nature of the sound. These
verbs show the intransitive swarm form of the locative alternation (cf. sec.
2.3.4). The verb sound appears to behave slightly differently from the others,
but its behavior may be attributable to the existence of several senses of this
verb. For instance, sound does allow transitive causative uses, but it is possible
that in its transitive use the verb does not simply describe the bringing
into existence of a sound, but rather describes the bringing into existence of a
particular type of sound. Evidence for this proposal is that the transitive use of
sound appears to allow a more limited range of noun phrases as direct object
than its intransitive use allows as subject.
47.5 Verbs of Group Existence
The verbs in the next three subclasses relate to the existence of a group or
aggregate.
47.5.1 Swarm Verbs
References: Bach (1980), J. Lumsden (1991), Salkoff (1983). See also
references under Spray/Load Verbs (sec. 9.7).
Class Members: abound, bustle, crawl, creep, hop, run, swarm, swim, teem,
throng
Properties:
(920) Locative Alternation:
a. Bees are swarming in the garden. (locative variant)
b. The garden is swarming with bees. (with variant)
(921) Locative Inversion:
a. A striped fish swam in the aquarium.
b. In the aquarium swam a striped fish.
(922) There-Insertion:
a. A striped fish swam in the aquarium.
b. In the aquarium there swam a striped fish.
254
(923) * Causative Alternations:
a. Bees are swarming in the garden.
* The beekeeper swarmed bees in the garden.
b. The garden is swarming with bees.
* The beekeeper swarmed the garden with bees.
Section 47.5.2
Comments: These verbs participate in the form of the locative alternation
displayed by intransitive verbs; specifically, the alternation they display is
most similar to that shown by the spray/load verbs. These verbs show the
"holistic/partitive" effect; the "holistic" interpretation is associated with the
subject of the with variant. Some of these verbs are run verbs (sec. 51.3.2) in
their basic sense, and are cross-listed here.
47.5.2 Herd Verbs
Class Members: accumulate, aggregate, amass, assemble, cluster, collect,
congregate, convene, flock, gath􀍟r, group, herd, huddle, mass
Properties:
(924) The cattle are herding in the pasture.
(925) * Locative Alternation:
a. The cattle are herding in the pasture.
b. * The pasture is herding with cattle.
(926) Causative Alternation (some verbs) :
a. The cattle herded.
b. I herded the cattle.
(927) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a herd
Comments: These verbs are found in a syntactic frame that resembles the
locative variant associated with the intransitive form of the locative alternation
shown by the swarm verbs (sec. 2.3.4). The verbs in this class take collective
NPs as subjects, and some of them are zero-related to collective nouns. Some
of these verbs have a transitive use which is included under the shake verbs
(sec. 22.3); the properties relating to this use are described there.
47.5.3 Bulge Verbs
Class Members: bristle, bulge, seethe
Properties:
(928) The bag is bulging with groceries.
Section 47.6
(929) * Locative Alternation:
a. * Groceries are bulging in the bag.
b. The bag is bulging with groceries.
(930) * Causative Alternations:
a. The bag is bulging (with groceries).
b. * I bulged the bag (with groceries).
255
Comments: These verbs are found in a syntactic frame that resembles the with
variant associated with the intransitive swarm form of the locative alternation
(cf. sec. 2.3.4). There is a "holistic" interpretation associated with the subject
of these verbs.
47.6 Verbs of Spatial Configuration
References: Dixon ( 1 99 1), Dowty ( 1 975, 1979), Keams ( 1 99 1), G. Lakoff
( 1 966), Lehrer ( 1 990), B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav ( 1 992b), Ljung (1 980),
Mulder and Wehrmann ( 1 989), Snell-Homby ( 1 983)
Class Members: balance, bend, bow, crouch, dangle, flop, fly, hang, hover,
jut, kneel, lean, lie, loll, loom; lounge, nestle, open, perch, plop, project, protrude,
recline, rest, rise, roost, sag, sit, slope, slouch, slump, sprawl, squat,
stand, stoop, straddle, swing, tilt, tower
Properties:
(93 1 ) A statue stood on the comer/next to the building.
(932) There-Insertion:
a. A statue of Jefferson stood on the comer.
b. There stood on the comer a statue of Jefferson.
(933) Locative Inversion:
a. A statue of Jefferson stood on the comer of the two boulevards.
b. On the comer of the two boulevards stood a statue of Jefferson.
(934) Causative Alternation (some verbs):
a. They stood the statue on the pedestal.
b. The statue stood on the pedestal.
(935) the hanging gardens
the leaning tower
(936) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* hung gardens
Comments: As part of their meaning, the members of this subset of the
verbs of existence specify the spatial configuration of an entity with respect to
256 Section 47.7
some location. Some of these verbs have transitive uses as verbs of putting in
a spatial configuration; the properties associated with this use are listed under
Verbs of Putting in a Spatial Configuration (sec. 9.2). This transitive use has
been included here under the label "causative alternation." This alternation is
not the causative/inchoative alternation, since the intransitive use does not have
the change of state or change of location interpretation that is associated with
the intransitive variant of the prototypical verbs showing that alternation. In
English, many verbs of spatial configuration, such as hang or sit, also have
another intransitive use as verbs of assuming a position; these verbs are crosslisted
(cf. sec. 50). However, there are some languages where verbs of spatial
configuration and verbs of assuming a position are not lexicalized by a single
verb form; see Talmy ( 1 985) for a brief discussion of the lexicalization patterns
associated with these verbs.
When those verbs that permit both intransitive uses are found in the
there-insertion or locative inversion constructions, they only have the spatial
configuration interpretation, although the same verbs might be open to both
intepretations when used in other contexts.
47.7 Meander Verbs
References: D.C. Bennett ( 1 975), Brugman and G. Lakoff ( 1988), Dowty
( 1979), Jackendoff ( 1 990b), G. Lakoff ( 1 987), B . Levin and Rappaport Hovav
( 1 992b)
Class Members: cascade, climb, crawl, cut, drop, go, meander, plunge, run,
straggle, stretch, sweep, tumble, tum, twist, wander, weave, wind
Properties:
(937) The river runs from the lake to the sea.
(938) The stream winds/twists/crawls through the valley.
(939) Locative Inversion:
a. A rushing stream ran through the valley.
b. Through the valley ran a rushing stream.
(940) There-Insertion:
a. A rushing stream ran through the valley.
b. There ran through the valley a rushing stream.
Comments: The verbs in this class have been described by Dowty ( 1 979)
as "pseudo-motional locative" verbs. This label reflects the fact that many of
these verbs are verbs of motion that are being used to describe the location of
a long continuous object such as a road or a river. A few of the verbs that are
used to describe the location of such an object are not verbs of motion in their
Section 47.8 257
basic sense (e.g., sweep, cut), although even they do show an extended sense as
a verb of motion. It is possible that verbs of motion other than the ones listed
here could also show this use.
47.8 Verbs of Contiguous Location
References: Dixon ( 1 99 1), Green ( 1 97 1), Grimshaw ( 1 990), Gruber ( 1 965,
1 976), Nunberg ( 1 978), Pinker ( 1 989), Rice ( 1987)
Class Members: abut, adjoin, blanket, border, bound, bracket, bridge, cap,
contain, cover, cross, dominate, edge, encircle, enclose, fence, fill, flank, follow, .

(942) Adjectival Passive Participle:
France is bordered by Italy.
* France is bordered.
(943) Understood Reciprocal Object Alternation (some verbs):
a. Italy touches France.
Italy and France touch.
b. Snow caps the mountain.
* Snow and the mountain cap.
Comments: These verbs are used to describe a spatial relation between two
entities that are contiguous in space. They are basically transitive; the two entities
are expressed as the subject and object of the verb, respectively. Some
members of this class (e.g., intersect, meet, touch) describe a symmetric relationship
between two entities; these verbs may show the understood reciprocal
object alternation. A number of the verbs in this class have other senses; several
are found among the fill verbs (sec. 9.8), while others are listed among
the members of other verb classes. In their other uses, these verbs are agentive
and mean roughly "cause something to be in a particular spatial relation that
involves contiguity." As noted by Grimshaw ( 1 990), these verbs require a by
phrase in the passive.

48 Verbs of Appearance, Disappearance,
and Occurrence
48.1 Verbs of Appearance
48.1.1 Appear Verbs
References: Faber ( 1 987), Firbas ( 1 966), Kimball ( 1 973b ), B . Levin and Rappaport
Hovav ( 1 992b). See also references under There-Insertion and Locative
Inversion (sec. 6).
Class Members: appear, arise, awake, awaken, break, burst, come, dawn,
derive, develop, emanate, emerge, erupt, evolve, exude, flow, form, grow, gush,
issue, materialize, open, plop, result, rise, spill, spread, steal, stem, stream,
supervene, surge, wax;
Class Members: pop up, show up, tum up
Properties:
(944) A ship appeared.
(945) A ship appeared on the horizon.
(946) There-Insertion (most verbs) :
a. A ship appeared on the horizon.
b. There appeared a ship on the horizon.
(947) Locative Inversion (most verbs):
a. A large ship appeared on the horizon.
b. On the horizon appeared a large ship.
(948) * Causative Alternations (many verbs):
a. A dove appeared from the magician's sleeve.
b. * The magician appeared a dove from his sleeve.
(949) Adjectival Perfect Participle:
a recently appeared book
Comments: These verbs describe the appearance of an entity on the scene.
Although all of these verbs can take prepositional phrase complements, some of
them do not require them. These verbs also differ as to the types of prepositional
phrases they allow. Some take various types of locative phrases; others are
limited to from phrases.
In determining what verbs to include in this class, a rather broad definition
of the notion "verb of appearance" was used. Further study might suggest that
some of the verbs listed should not have been included. However, it is worth
Section 48. 1 .2 259
pointing out that some of the verbs listed, such as break and open, are basically
verbs of change of state and are used as verbs of appearance in an extended,
possibly figurative, sense. This dual class membership makes it difficult to
determine whether the verbs in this class behave uniformly with respect to
the causative alternations. As noted above, many of these verbs do not have
transitive uses with a causative interpretation, and it seems that those verbs
that do show transitive causative uses show them on a sense other than their
appearance sense, but this needs to be more carefully studied.
For further discussion of these verbs, see the references listed under Locative
Inversion and There-Insertion (sec. 6), since appear verbs are considered to
belong to one of the canonical classes of verbs found in these constructions.
48.1.2 Reflexive Verbs of Appearance
References: Geniusiene (1987), Poutsma (1904), Sigler (1985)
Class Members: assert, declare, define, express, form, intrude, manifest,
offer, pose, present, proffer, recommend, shape, show, suggest
Properties:
(950) A solution immediately presented itself.
(951) * A solution immediately presented.
(952) A solution immediately presented itself to him.
(953) * There-Insertion:
a. A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday.
b. * There presented itself a wonderful opportunity yesterday.
(954) * Locative Inversion:
a. A wonderful opportunity prest;�nted itself to him yesterday.
b. * To him presented itself a wonderful opportunity.
(955) Reflexive of Appearance Alternation (except intrude) :
a. I presented a solution yesterday.
b. A solution presented itself yesterday.
Comments: The verbs in this class are being used as verbs of appearance. All
of them (with the possible exception of intrude) can be used transitively as twoargument
verbs; however, such a use of these verbs is obligatorily associated
with the presence of a reflexive pronoun as object. When they are used as verbs
of appearance, the subject of these verbs bears the same semantic relation to
the verb as the object does in the ordinary transitive use. The argument that
is the subject of the typical transitive use of the verb is not expressed. These
verbs are set apart from the appear verbs above both by the existence of a
260 Section 48.2
transitive use and by the obligatory occurrence of a reflexive pronoun as object.
These verbs appear not to be found in the there-insertion and locative inversion
constructions.
48.2 Verbs of Disappearance
Class Members: die, disappear, expire, lapse, perish, vanish
Properties:
(956) The crowd vanished.
(957) ?? There-Insertion:
a. A valuable 1 3th-century manuscript recently vanished from the
library.
b.?? There recently vanished from the library a valuable 1 3th-century
manuscript.
(958) ?? Locative Inversion:
a. A valuable 13th-century manuscript recently vanished from the
library.
b.?? From the library vanished recently a valuable 1 3th-century
manuscript.
(959) * Causative Alternations:
a. The rabbit vanished into thin air.
b. * The magician vanished a rabbit into thin air.
(960) Adjectival Perfect Participle:
vanished civilizations
Comments: These verbs describe the disappearance or going out of existence
of some entity. It has been noted in the literature on there-insertion and
locative inversion that these verbs are not typically acceptable in either of these
constructions; however, Kimball ( 1 973b) observes that their acceptability can
be improved in carefully constructed contexts, particularly those contrived so
that these verbs take on an appearance sense.
48.3 Verbs of Occurrence
Class Members: ensue, eventuate, happen, occur, recur, transpire
Properties:
(96 1 ) The accident happened at three o' clock.
(962) There-Insertion:
a. A serious accident happened yesterday.
b. There happened a serious ar;cident yesterday.
Section 49
(963) Locative Inversion:
a. A serious accident happened in front of them.
b. In front of them happen
.
ed a serious accident:
(964) * Causative Alternations:
a. The accident happened.
b. * The motorist happened the accident.
26 1
Comments: These verbs describe the occurrence of an event. They are sometimes
included among the appear verbs , and like the appear verbs, they are
found in the locative inversion and there-insertion constructions. These verbs
are not found in transitive uses with a causative interpretation.
49 Verbs of Body-Internal Motion
References: Cowper ( 1990a), Jackendoff ( 1990b), B. Levin and Rappaport
Hovav ( 1992b)
Class Members: buck, fidget, flap, gyrate, kick, rock, squirm, sway, teeter,
totter, twitch, waggle, wiggle, wobble, wriggle
Properties:
(965) Sylvia fidgeted.
(966) * Causative Alternations:
a. Sylvia fidgeted.
b. * The lecture fidgeted Sylvia.
(967) * Body-Part Object:
* Sylvia fidgeted her fingers.
(968) Resultative Phrase (some verbs) :
Sylvia fidgeted herself into a tizzy.
* Sylvia twitched the teacher angry.
(969) Directional Phrase:
Sylvia wriggled out of her seat.
The sick man wobbled down the stairs.
Comments: These verbs, which describe movements of the body, take animate
subjects. In isolation, they do not entail any displacement; however, in
the presence of a goal or directional phrase, they may. Some of these verbs are
262 Section 50
also used as verbs describing modes of being involving motion; these verbs are
cross-listed (sec. 47.3). Some of the verbs of body-internal motion, particularly
those that involve the movement of a particular body part, can be used transitively,
with the part of the body that is involved as the direct object. The verbs
in this class are typically not found in any of the causative alternations.
50 Verbs of Assuming a Position
References: B . Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1992b)
Class Members: bend, bow, crouch, flop, hang, kneel, lean, lie, perch, plop,
rise, sit, slouch, slump, sprawl, squat, stand, stoop, straddle
Properties:
(970) The dog flopped in the comer/onto the bed.
(971) * There-Insertion:
a. A dog lay in the comer.
b. * There lay a dog in the comer. (on the relevant interpretation)
* There lay in the corner a dog. (on the relevant interpretation)
(972} * Locative Inversion:
a. A dog lay in the corner.
b. * In the corner lay a dog. (on the relevant interpretation)
Comments: All of the verbs in this class have several senses. This section
describes the properties these verbs show in the sense of "assume the spatial
configuration specific to the verb." However, they all have another intransitive
sense as verbs of being in a particular spatial configuration ( cf. sec. 4 7 .6), and
many of them also have a transitive sense as verbs of putting in a spatial configuration
(cf. sec. 9.2); all of the verbs in this class are cross-listed as appropriate.
(Some languages morphologically distinguish these different senses; see Talmy
( 1985).) In the assume position sense these verbs are incompatible with locative
inversion and there-insertion, even though in the being in a spatial configuration
sense they are found in these constructions. These verbs cannot be used
transitively in the sense of "cause to assume the spatial configuration specific
to the verb." See also the discussion under Verbs of Spatial Configuration and
Verbs of Putting in a Spatial Configuration.

51.1 Verbs of Inherently Directed Motion
Class Members: advance, arrive, ascend, ?climb, come, ?cross, depart, descend,
enter, escape, exit, fall, flee, go, leave, plunge, recede, return, ·rise,
tumble
Properties:
(973) The convict escaped.
(974) Locative Preposition Drop Alternation (some verbs):
a. The convict escaped from the police.
b. The convict escaped the police.
(975) * Causative Alternations:
a. The convict escaped.
b. * The collaborators escaped the convict.
(on the interpretation "cause to escape")
(976) * Measure Phrase:
* The convict escaped three miles.
(977) Adjectival Perfect Participle:
an escaped convict (a convict that has escaped)
* an escaped jail
(978) Depictive Phrase:
The convict escaped exhausted.
(on the interpretation where the convict escapes feeling exhausted)
(979) * Resultative Phrase:
* The convict escaped exhausted.
(on the interpretation where the escape exhausts the convict)
264 Section 5 1 .2
Comments: The meaning of these verbs includes a specification of the direction
of motion, even in the absence of an overt directional complement. For
some verbs this specification is in deictic terms; for others it is in nondeictic
terms. None of these verbs specify the manner of motion. However, the members
of tpis class do not behave uniformly in all respects. They differ as to how
they can express the goal, source, or path of motion; depending on the verb,
these may be expressed via a prepositional phrase, as a direct object, or both.
The verb cross has been include<;l here because of its meaning, but it does not
behave in all respects like the other verbs in this class; for instance, it is always
transitive. The verbs in this class have received a certain amount of attention in
the literature on the Unaccusative Hypothesis.
51.2 Leave Verbs
Class Members: abandon, desert, leave
Properties:
(980) We abandoned the area.
(98 1 ) * We abandoned from the area.
(982) Adjectival Passive Participle (some verbs):
an abandoned house
Comments: These verbs do not specify a manner of motion; they simply
indicate that motion away from a location has taken place. The direct object
of Lhese verbs is understood to be the location that has been left. The location
cannot be expressed in a prepositional phrase.
51.3 Manner of Motion Verbs
These verbs describe motion that typically, though not necessarily, involves
displacement, but none of them specifies an inherent direction as part of its
meaning. All of these verbs have meanings that include a notion of manner or
means of motion. They differ from each other in terms of the specific manner
or means.
51.3.1 Roll Verbs
Class Members:
bounce, drift, drop, float, glide, move , roll, slide, swing
MOTION AROUND AN Axis: coil, revolve, rotate, spin, tum, twirl, twist, whirl,
wind
Properties:
(983) The ball rolled.
Section 5 1 .3.2
(984) The ball rolled down the hill/over the hill/into the gutter.
(985) Causative/lnchoative Alternation (most verbs):
a. Bill rolled the ball down the hill.
b. The ball rolled down the hill.
(986) * Locative Preposition Drop Alternation:
a. The ball rolled down the hill.
b. * The ball rolled the hill.
(987) Resultative Phrase:
The drawer rolled open.
* The cart rolled the rubber off its wheels.
* The cart rolied its way down the hill.
(988) Adjectival Passive Participle:
a constantly rolled ball (related to transitive roll)
265
Comments: These verbs relate to manners of motion that are characteristic of
inanimate entities (i.e., where there is not necessarily protagonist control on the
part of the moving entity). In the absence of a prepositional phrase specifying
direction, none of these verbs indicates the direction of motion. Many of the
roll verbs that describe motion around an axis take a rather restricted range of
prepositions heading the prepositional phrase that describes the path of motion.
Most of the verbs in this class show the causative/inchoative alternation.
However, this alternation is possible only if the motion is externally controllable.
This restriction may explain why some of the verbs are not eligible for
this alternation. For instance, the verbs glide and drift do not participate in this
alternation, and gliding and drifting are not typically externally controllable.
Those verbs that do have a transitive causative use typically show the properties
of the coil verb subclass of the verbs of putting if they describe motion
around an axis (cf. sec. 9.6), or the slide verb subclass of the verbs of sending
and carrying; otherwise ( cf. sec. 1 1 .2). (The verb roll is the exception, showing
properties of both classes.) Those verbs with transitive uses are also listed under
the appropriate transitive class. This section focuses on the properties related to
their intransitive use; the properties related to their transitive use are discussed
under Slide Verbs or Coil Verbs, as appropriate.
51.3.2 Run Verbs
Class Members: amble, backpack, bolt, bounce, bound, bowl, canter, carom,
cavort, charge, clamber, climb, clump, coast, crawl, creep, dart, dash, dodder,
drift, file, flit, float, fly, frolic, gallop, gambol, glide, goosestep, hasten, hike,
hobble, hop, hurry, hurtle, inch, jog, journey, jump, leap_, limp, lollop, lope,
lumber, lurch, march, meander, mince, mosey, nip, pad, parade, perambulate,
266 Section 5 1 .3.2
plod, prance, promenade, prowl, race, ramble, roam, roll, romp, rove, run, rush,
sashay, saunter, scamper, scoot, scram, scramble, scud, scurry, scutter, scuttle,
shamble, shuffle, sidle, skedaddle, skip, skitter, skulk, sleepwalk, slide, slink,
slither, slog, slouch, sneak, somersault, speed, stagger, stomp, stray, streak,
stride, stroll; strut, stumble, stump, swagger, sweep, swim, tack, tear, tiptoe,
toddle, totter, traipse, tramp, travel , trek, troop, trot, trudge, trundle, vault,
waddle, wade, walk, wander, whiz, zigzag, zoom
Properties:
(989) The horse jumped over/across/into/out ofthe stream.
(990) Induced Action Alternation (some verbs):
a. The horse jumped over the fence.
Tom jumped the horse over the fence.
b. The lions jumped through the hoop.
The lion tamer jumped the lions through the hoop.
(99 1 ) Locative Preposition Drop Alternation (some verbs):
a. The horse jumped over the stream.
b. The horse jumped the stream.
(992) There-Insertion :
a. A little white rabbit jumped out of the box.
b. There jumped out of the box a little white rabbit.
(993) Locative Inversion:
a. A little white rabbit jumped out of the box.
b. Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit.
(994) Measure Phrase (some verbs):
We walked five miles.
(995) Resultative Phrase:
a. We walked ourselves into a state of exhaustion.
* We walked into a state of exhaustion.
b. Tom ran the soles off his shoes.
(996) Adjectival Passive Participle (some verbs):
the jumped/run/galloped horse
(a horse that has been jumped/run/galloped by someone)
(997) * Adjectival Perfect Participle:
* the jumped horse (on the interpretation: a horse that has jumped)
(998) * Cognate Object:
* The horse jumped a high jump.
Section 5 I .4. 1
(999) Zero-related Nominal (some verbs):
a jump, a run, a walk
267
Comments: Most of these verbs describe the manners in which animate
entities can move, although some of them may be used to describe the movement
of inanimate entities. Although these verbs describe the displacement of an
object in a particular manner or by a particular means, no specific direction of
motion is implied unless they occur with an explicit directional phrase. The run
verbs probably need to be further subdivided. For instance, not all of them can be
found in the induced action alternation, nor do they all allow locative preposition
drop. When these verbs are found in the induced action construction, they may
or may not show an accompanied motion interpretation, as the two examples
illustrate. The verbs in this class may be found in the locative inversion and
there-insertion constructions, particularly when they occur with a directional
phrase. (When they are found in these constructions with locative phrases, they
may be being used as verbs of existence; however, these verbs are not crosslisted
as verbs of existence, since further study of this phenomenon is necessary.)
The run verbs are found to a limited extent in resultative constructions in which
the resultative phrase is predicated of a nonsubcategorized object. However,
despite the fact that many have zero-related result nominals, they do not take
cognate objects.
51.4 Verbs of Motion Using a Vehicle
51.4.1 Verbs That Are Vehicle Names
References: Bladin ( 1 9 1 1 ), E.V. Clark and H.H. Cllirk ( 1 979), Jespersen
( 1 942), Leitner ( 1 974), Marchand ( 1 969, 1 974), Ostler and Atkins ( 1 99 1 ) ,
Sehnert and Sharwood-Smith ( 1 973)
Class Members: balloon, bicycle, bike, boat, bobsled, bus, cab, canoe, caravan,
chariot, coach, cycle, dogsled, ferry, gondola, helicopter, jeep, jet, kayak,
moped, motor, motorbike, motorcycle, parachute, punt, raft, rickshaw, rocket,
skate, skateboard, ski, sled, sledge, sleigh, taxi, toboggan, tram, trolley, yacht
Properties:
( 1000) They skated.
( 100 1 ) They skated along the canal/across the lake.
( 1 002) Induced Action Alternation (some verbs):
a. He skated Penny around the rink.
b. Penny skated around the rink.
268 Section 5 1 .4.2
(1003) Locative Preposition Drop Alternation (some verbs):
a. They skated along the canals.
b. They skated the canals.
(1004) Resultative Phrase:
Penny skated her skate blades blunt.
Comments: These verbs.are all zero-related to nouns that are vehicle names;
they mean roughly "go using the vehicle named by the noun." In principle, it
should be possible for any vehicle name to be used as a verb of this type. The
members of this set of verbs describe the motion of an entity, but no specific
direction of motion is implied unless there is an explicit directional phrase
present. These verbs have not been attested in the locative inversion or thereinsertion
constructions, although it is possible that they might be found in these
constructions.
51.4.2 Verbs That Are Not Vehicle Names
Class Members: cruise, drive, fly, oar, paddle, pedal, ride, row, sail, tack
Properties:
(1005) They rowed.
(1006)
(1007)
(1008)
(1009)
They rowed along the canal/across the lake.
Induced Action Alternation (some verbs):
a. He rowed Penny across the lake.
b. Penny rowed across the lake.
Locative Preposition Drop Alternation (some verbs):
a. They rowed along the canals of Venice.
b. They rowed the canals of Venice.
Resultative Phrase:
Penny rowed her palms raw.
Comments: Although these verbs are not zero-related to vehicle names, they
all describe motion using a particular type of vehicle. Some of these verbs are
zero-related to nouns that name parts used in propelling these vehicles. The
members of this set of verbs describe the motion of an entity, but no specific
direction of motion is implied unless there is an explicit directional phrase
present. These verbs have not been attested ·in the locative inversion or thereinsertion
constructions, although it is possible that they might be found in these
constructions.
51.5 Waltz Verbs
References: Fellbaum and Kegl ( 1989), Ostler and Atkins ( 1991)
Section 5 1 .6 269
Class Members: boogie, bop, cancan, clog, conga, dance, foxtrot, jig, jitterbug,
jive, pirouette, polka, quickstep, rumba, samba, shuffle, squaredance,
tango, tapdance, waltz
Properties:
( 1 0 1 0) They waltzed.
( 1 0 1 1 ) They waltzed across/into/through the room.
( 1 0 1 2) Induced Action Alternation:
a. She waltzed across the floor.
b. He waltzed her across the floor. (if dance involves a partner)
( 1 0 13) Resultative Phrase:
She waltzed the soles off her shoes .
. ( 1 0 1 4) Cognate Object:
They waltzed every other waltz.
Comments: These . verbs are zero-related to names of dances and mean
roughly "perform the dance." In principle, any dance name should give rise
to a zero-related verb of this type. Although the members of this set of verbs
describe motion, no specific direction of motion is implied unless there is
an explicit directional phrase present. In this respect, these verbs pattern like
the run verbs above. Verbs taking their names from dances involving partners
appear to show slightly different behavior from those that do not; these are the
verbs most likely to be found in the induced action alternation. Waltz verbs
have not been attested in the locative inversion or there-insertion constructions,
although it is possible that they might be found in these constructions. These
verbs, although only listed under verbs of motion here, could also be viewed
as performance verbs (cf. sec. 26.7).
51.6 Chase Verbs
References: Dixon ( 199 1), Gawron ( 1 983), Gruber ( 1965)
Class Members: chase, follow, pursue, shadow, tail, track, trail
Properties:
( 1 0 1 5) Jackie chased the thief (down the street).
( 1 0 1 6) Jackie chased after the thief. (few verbs)
( 10 1 7) * Causative Alternations:
a. Jackie chased the thief (down the street).
b. * The thief chased (down the street).
270 Section 5 1 .7
Comments: The chase verbs are typically transitive, with the chaser as
subject and the person being chased as object. Some of these verbs allow an
intransitive use, with the chaser as subject and a prepositional phrase headed
by after expressing what is being chased.
51.7 Accompany Verbs
Class Members: accompany, conduct, escort, guide, lead, shepherd
Properties:
( 1 0 1 8) Jackie accompanied Rose.
( 10 19) Jackie accompanied Rose to the store.
( 1020) * Causative Alternations:
a. Jackie accompanied Rose.
b. * Rose accompanied. (on the interpretation "be accompanied")
Comments: These verbs relate to one person taking a second from one place
to another. The verbs are differentiated by the nature of the relation between
the two participants.
52 Avoid Verbs
Class Members: avoid, ?boycott, dodge, duck, elude, evade, shun, sidestep
Properties:
( 102 1 ) We avoided the area.
( 1022) * We avoided from the area.
Comments: The verbs in this class are related to avoidance. Many of these
verbs are also found with gerundive sentential complements.
Section 53.2 27 1
53 Verbs of Lingering and Rushing
References: Dixon (1991), Sneli-Hornby (1983)
The verbs in this class describe the shortening or the prolongation of the time
course of an event.
53.1 Verbs of Lingering
Class Members: dally, dawdle, delay, dither, hesitate, linger, loiter, tarry
Properties:
(1023) Sasha dawdled in the museum.
(1024) Sasha dawdled over lunch.
(1 025) * Causative Alternations:
a. Sasha dawdled over lunch.
b. * Phyllis dawdled Sasha over lunch.
Comments: These verbs describe types of "lingering," as the name of their
class suggests. Some of them can appear with a prepositional phrase headed
by over that describes the event whose duration is protracted as a consequence
of an action carried out by the subject of the verb. Only delay can be used
transitively, to describe causing a delay.
53.2 Verbs of Rushing
Class Members: hasten, hurry, rush
Properties:
(1026) Maggie hurried through the museum.
( 1 027) Maggie hurried with her lunch.
(1028) Causative Alternation:
a. Her sister hurried.
b. Maggie hurried her sister.
Comments: These verbs describe doing something quickly. All of these verbs
can be used transitively with a causative interpretation.
272 Section 54
54 Measure Verbs
References: Anderson ( 1 988), Bach ( 1 980), B owers ( 1 989), Croft ( 1 99 1 ),
Fillmore ( 1 977b), Keg! and Fellbaum ( 1 988, 1 989), Klooster ( 1972, 1 973,
1 978), Na ( 1 986), Nunberg ( 1 978), Rizzi ( 1990)
54.1 Register Verbs
Class Members: measure, read, register, total, weigh
Properties:
( 1 029) The package weighed ten pounds.
( 1 030) * Passive:
a. The package weighed ten pounds.
b. * Ten pounds v,:as weighed by the package.
( 1 03 1 ) * Causative Alternation:
a. The package weighed ten pounds.
b. * I weighed the package ten pounds.
( 1 032) I weighed the package.
Comments: These verbs describe the value of some attribute of an entity
(e.g., height, weight, temperature) along a scale relevant to the characterization
of this property. The particular attribute is determined by the verb. Register
verbs can be used intransitively with a postverbal noun phrase expressing
the measurement; this noun phrase does not show the properties of a direct
object. When these verbs are used transitively, the noun phrase specifying the
measurement cannot be expressed. Due to their inability to passivize, these
verbs are sometimes discussed briefly in studies of the passive.
54.2 Cost Verbs
Class Members: carry, cost, last, take
Properties:
( 1 033) The book costs $ 1 0.
( 1 034) * Passive:
* $ 1 0 was cost (by the book).
( 1 035) * Causative Alternations:
a. The book costs $ 1 0 .
b . * I costed the book $ 1 0.
( 1 036) * I costed the book.
Section 54.4 273
Comments: These verbs describe the value of some attribute of an entity (e.g.,
height, weight, temperature) along a scale relevant to the characterization of this
property. The particular attribute is determined by the verb. Cost verbs can be
used intransitively, with a postverbal noun phrase expressing the measurement;
this noun phrase does not show the properties of a direct object. Unlike the
register verbs above, these verbs cannot be used transitively. Due to their
inability to passivize, these verbs are sometimes discussed briefly in studies of
the passive.
54.3 Fit Verbs
References: Perlmutter and Postal ( 1984)
Class Members: carry, contain, fit, feed, hold, house, seat, serve, sleep, store,
take, use
( 1 037) Each room sleeps five people.
( 1 038) Location Subject Alternation:
a. We sleep five people in each room.
b. Each room sleeps five people.
( 1 039) * Passive:
* Five people are slept in each room.
Comments: All the verbs in this class belong to other classes in their basic
use; many of them are verbs of putting (cf. sec. 9). However, this section
considers their use with oblique subjects that are locations . They are used with
such location subjects to describe the capacity of the location with respect to
the action named by the verb. Due to their inability to passivize, these verbs
are sometimes discussed briefly in studies of the passive.
54.4 Price Verbs
Class Members: appraise, assess, estimate, fix, peg, price, rate, value
Properties:
( 1 040) The dealer valued the book.
( 1041) The dealer valued the book at $200.
( 1 042) * Causative Alternations:
a. The dealer valued the book at $200.
b. * The book valued (at) $200.
Comments: These verbs describe an agent measuring the value of an attribute
of an entity along a scale relevant to the characterization of that attribute. They
274 Section 54.5
allow for the specification of the value of the measurement. These verbs are
always used transitively.
54.5 Bill Verbs
Class Members: bet, bill, charge, fine, mulct, overcharge, save, spare, tax,
tip, undercharge, wager
Properties:
( 1 043) The phone company billed me $ 1 0 for that phone call.
( 1 044) * Dative Alternation:
a. * The phone company billed $ 1 0 to me.
b. The phone company billed me $ 1 0.
( 1 045) * As Alternation:
a. The phone company billed me $10.
b. * The phone company billed $10 as me.
Comments: These verbs. describe one person (or institution) bringing about
a particular relationship between a second person (or institution) and a sum
of money; the relationship depends on the verb. These verbs are found in the
double object construction and do not permit the dative alternation.
55 Aspectual Verbs
References: Brinton ( 1 988), Dixon ( 1 991), Fischer and Marshall ( 1 969),
Freed ( 1 979), Giv6n ( 1 972), ter Meulen ( 1 990), ter Meulen and Rooryck ( 1 99 1 ),
Newmeyer ( 1 975), Perlmutter ( 1 970), Pustejovsky ( 1 99 1 a), J.R. Ross ( 1 972),
Talmy ( 1 99 1)
These verbs describe the initiation, termination, or continuation of an activity.
They have been extensively discussed in the works above, particularly
with respect to their sentential complement-taking properties; however, these
properties are not discussed here.
55.1 Begin Verbs
Class Members: begin, cease, commence, continue, end, finish, halt, keep,
proceed, repeat, resume, start, stop, terminate
Section 56
Properties:
( 1 046)
( 1 047)
The meeting began at 4 P.M.
Causative Alternation (some verbs):
a. The meeting began at 4 P.M.
b. I began the meeting at 4 P.M.
275
Comments: The members of this subset of the aspectual verbs all have
intransitive uses, and some of them also allow transitive causative uses. These
verbs differ with respect to the types of sentential complements they take:
some take only gerundive complements, while others take both gerundive
and infinitival complements. Since this work is not concerned with sentential
complement-taking properties, the begin verbs have not been further subdivided
with respect to this facet of their behavior. When these verbs take nominal
arguments, there is some variation among them as to the types of noun phrases
that are allowable.
55.2 Complete Verbs
Class Members: complete, discontinue, initiate, quit
Properties:
( 1 048) Wilma completed the assignment.
( 1 049) * Causative Alternations:
a. Wilma completed the assignment.
b. * The assignment completed.
Comments: The members of this set of aspectual verbs again describe the
initiation, continuation, or termination of an activity, but unlike the members
of the other subset of aspectual verbs above, complete verbs are not used
intransitively. These verbs may also take sentential complements, but this facet
of their behavior is not explored further here.
56 Weekend Verbs
References: Bladin ( 1 91 1) , E. V. Clark and H.H. Clark ( 1979), Duszak ( 1980),
Jespersen ( 1 942), Karius ( 1 985), Marchand ( 1 969, 1 974)
Class Members: December, holiday, honeymoon, overnight, sojourn,
summer, vacation, weekend, winter
276 Section 57 ·
Properties:
( 1 050) My family always summered at the seashore.
Comments: With the exception of overnight, the verbs in this class are zerorelated
to nominals. Each of these verbs relates to spending a period of time
(either named by or associated with the noun from which the verb takes its name)
at some location, which is expressed as a prepositional phrase complement of
the verb. It is likely that more verbs of this type might be coined; for instance,
the names of other months might be used as verbs of this type.
57 Weather Verbs
References: Bolinger ( 1972a, 1 977a), Carter ( 1 988), Darden ( 1 973), Dixon
( 1 99 1), Langacker ( 1 99 1 ), Marchand ( 1 969, 1 974), Napoli ( l 989a), Pesetsky
( 1 992), J.R. Ross ( 1 973), Ruwet ( 1 986, 1 99 1 )
Class Members: blow, clear, drizzle, fog, freeze, gust, hail, howl, lightning,
mist, mizzle, pelt, pour, precipitate, rain, roar, shower, sleet, snow, spit, spot,
sprinkle, storm, swelter, teem, thaw, thunder
Properties:
( 105 1 ) It's raining.
( 1 052) It's raining cats and dogs.
( 1053) It was pelting with rain.
Comments: These verbs describe different types of weather. They take the
pronoun it as subject. This subject has been described as an expletive by some;
it is described by Bolinger as "ambient" it. Some of these verbs are best if
they occur with an aspectual particle, particularly up (It's fogging up). Some
of these verbs, especially those that are not zero-related to nouns and that
describe precipitation, can sometimes take a with phrase that expresses the
type of precipitation.

Verb Index
The index includes an alphabetical listing of the verbs referred to in Part I and Part II of the book.
Each verb is followed by a list of the sections that it is mentioned in. There has been no attempt
to distinguish and give separate entries to the different senses of a verb. Similarly, there is only
one entry in the index for verbs that are homographs. For instance, the entry in the index for jar
includes a list of all sections discussing jar, whether in the sense of "put in a jar" or in the sense of
"have a disagreeable effect on."

The second is that a given noun on its own may not denote a liquid but may be understood as doing so because of its modifiers. Thus The molten metal flowed into the mould does not require a metaphorical interpretation, but the fact that the metal is liquid is contributed by the adjective molten. This last example is handled in the same way as (11). Even without the adjective molten, it imposes the interpretation that the metal was in a liquid state and forces us to construct a suitable context, for example a foundry.

sks13		selects certain constituents to combine with
sks13		the heads are word level categories (remember the word level categories are: C,T,N,V,P,D,…)
sks13		if an element is the head of a string, the maximal string whose distribution is “controlled” by this element is a constituent
sks13		there is only one head per constituent
sks13		since constituents are continuous strings, the maximal string under the distributional control of a head must be a continuous string.

sks13		In general, no non-constituent has a unique head
sks13		The largest constituent with head H is notated HP or Hmax and is called the maximal or phrasal projection of H.
sks13		HP or Hmax is a constituent consisting of a constituent H’ and at most one sister called the specifier (or subject) of H. H’ is also notated and read H-bar (an H with one bar above it).
sks13		H’ or H-bar consists of the head H and some sisters. These sisters
sks13		HP can also consist of an HP and a sister constituent called an adjunct to H (or to HP).
sks13		Adjuncts, complements and specifiers are themselves phrasal constituents.

sks13		the kind of elements it selects
sks13		its contribution to meaning etc..
sks13		its phonological shape (i.e. how it is pronounced)
sks13		its bound or free nature (also a phonological property)
sks13		Locality: If a head selects an element, this element must be a sister to this head: Selection is local in the sense that it is restricted to operate under sisterhood.
sks13		Binary branching: in any morphological tree structure, a mother node only has two daughters at most.
sks13		Right hand head rule (RHHR): the head of a morphological constituent is (normally) the right daughter of this constituent.
sks13		X-bar theory: The syntactic structure of a head X with 0 or more complements, 0 or 1 subjects, and 0 or more adjuncts is regular across categories.

sks13		the verb say requires an animate subject, and there is such a subject in the structure namely Bill. And the verb elapse requires a subject that talks about time, and there is such a subject in this sentence namely time. What goes wrong here is that the subject that say requires must be its subject in the structure. The subject that elapse requires must be its subject, not the subject of some other verb.
sks13		wonder requires an if-clause as complement, and there is one, namely if Bill left. And say requires a that-clause as complement, and there is one, namely that John said if Bill left. Again we have the same problem: if a verb requires something of a complement, this complement must be realized in the structure as its own complement.
sks13		tell wants a DP complement and a CP complement, while put wants a DP and a PP. This PP cannot occur as complement of tell instead.

sks13		Locality of Selection for Syntax (preliminary):
sks13		If a head α selects β as complement, β is a complement of α.
sks13		If a head α selects β as subject, β is the subject of α or the subject of the clause containing α
sks13		If a head α selects β as an adjunct, β is the adjunct of α.

sks13		Time seems to elapse slowly in the tropics the main clause subject is selected by the infinitival verb, and the main clause subject is not selected by the main verb. To resolve the conflict between these conclusions and our ideas about locality of selection, we conclude that the DP time originates in the embedded clause. The simplest idea is that it originates as subject of the VP. Then the structure of this sentence before movement looks like this:
sks13		Time seems to elapse slowly in the tropics is well formed if and only the following is well formed too.

sks13		Semantic considerations: These should probably be mentioned first, since they are often easy to apply and usually lead to conclusions that are supported by the structural tests below. The semantic proposal is simply this: the subject and complements name the essential, distinctive parts of the action or event named by the verb. So a “putting” involves essentially an agent (the subject), a theme (the thing being put) and a location. Each putting occurs at a time and place too, but this is true of any action and so these are not distinctive to puttings.
sks13		Iteration: The number of complements is strictly limited by the selection properties of lexical items, but there can be any number of adjuncts. That is, adjuncts can be “iterated” or “repeated.”
sks13		Optionality: Complements are sometimes required, sometimes optional.
sks13		I praised  Mary  (obligatory complement)
sks13	?	* I praised
sks13		The moon glows  in the darkness  (optional adjunct)
sks13		The moon glows
sks13		adjuncts can modify “do so” VPs:
sks13		I sang a song with Mary while you did so  with Bill . (adjunct)
sks13	*	I saw Bill while you did so  Mary . (complement)
sks13		unlike complements, adjuncts are OK in “do what” pseudoclefts:
sks13		What Mary did  with Bill  was sing a song. (adjunct PP)
sks13	*	What Mary did  Bill  was give a book. (complement NP)
sks13		adjuncts can modify coordinated VPs: (not so useful as a test because of right node raising complements)
sks13		adjuncts can be left behind in VP-preposing:
sks13	*	Shei likes Maryi
sks13	*	Theyi like themi
sks13		Theyi like each otheri
sks13		Theyi like themselvesi

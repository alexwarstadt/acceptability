(16) decomposes each conceptual constituent into three basic feature complexes, one of which, the argument structure feature, allows for recursion of conceptual structure and hence an infinite class of possible concepts.

Argument Substitution (version 1)
b. If H is a verb, substitute the conceptual structure of the subject for the constituent indexed i (the external argument)
in H's LCS.
(7) applies in (2a) three times: part (a) substitutes the reading of the room for the variable in the LCS of into; it also substitutes the reading of into the room for the Path-variable in the LCS of run; part (b) substitutes the reading of John for the Thingvariable in the LCS of run.
(8)
a. Sincerity entered the room.
(9)
Argument Substitution (version 2)
b. If H is a verb, substitute the conceptual structure of the subject for the constituent C indexed i in H's LCS, if its conceptual category matches that of C.
(10)
a. Harry drank it.
b. Bill paid Harry a lot.
c. Sie frisst.
(11)
a. Harry drank (again).
b. Bill paid.
(12). (I will assume it means ''cause a liquid to go into one's mouth," obviously an oversimplification, but sufficient for the present point.)
(12)
a. Into each indexed constituent in H's LCS, fuse the conceptual structure of that phrase YP that satisfies the coindexed position in H's subcategorization feature.
b. If H is a verb, fuse the conceptual structure of the subject into the constituent indexed i in H's LCS.
(14)
a. Harry buttered the bread.
b. Joe pocketed the money.
The verbs in (14) have the conceptual structures in (15).
(16)
a. red hat (AP modifier of NP)
b. house in the woods (PP modifier of NP)
c. John went home quickly. (AdvP modifier of VP)
d. John went home at 6:00 (PP modifier of VP)
e. high on the hill (AP modifier of PP)
f. [PP here [PP in the house]] (PP modifier of PP)
(17) obviously must be constrained with respect to the possible combinations of ontological categories in head and modifier. For instance, I find it hard to imagine a Thing or an Event modifying a Mannerthough this may just reflect my lack of imagination.
(19)
By Argument Fusion, the readings of John and home are fused with that of go to form (20), the function-argument structure for the sentence.
(22)
Since the reading of the sentence must be consistent with both (20) and (22), it has to be (23), the fusion of the two.
(23)

a. X bought Y from Z for $5.
b. X obtained Y from Z for $5.
(4)
a. The box has books in it.
b. Bill brought/carried some books with him.
c. The list includes my name on it.
(5), the countertransfer (changing hands of money) is treated as an argument of a modifying function EXCH (''in exchange for").
The Theme of the countertransfer, [MONEY], is a completely incorporated argument, just like the incorporated argument [BUTTER] in the verb butter. (This analysis is justified in section 9.3; for now, nothing much hangs on its precise details.)
(7)
Bill bought the book.
(8)
The book was bought from Sue.
(9)
Bill bought a book from a funny old man.
(10)
This avoids the repetition of the conceptual material represented by SUE and BILL; at the same time it explicitly represents the unity of the characters carrying out the multiple roles.
(11).

Linking Condition (Neo-q-Criterion)
(14)
Bill dressed (Harry) (in a new suit).
(15)
a.
b.
(16)
a. Bill clothed Harry (in a new suit).
b. *Bill clothed in a new suit.
Thus one cannot appeal to any obvious general convention to account for the behavior of dress.
Now consider the conceptual structure of Bill dressed himself. This is for all intents and purposes synonymous with Bill dressed.
(17)
What is missing in this representation, of course, is the assignment of a value of x, in particular the value a. A rule is necessary to establish this assignment. The general form of the rule will be (18).
(19)
a. Bill talked to Mary about herself.
b. ?*Bill talked about Mary to herself.
(20)
a. ?Bill showed Mary herself (in the mirror).
b. *Bill showed Mary to herself (in the mirror).
(21)
a. Johni gave Suej orders PROj to leave.
b. Johni got from Suej orders PROi to leave.
(22)
a. Johni gave Suej a promise PROi to leave.
b. Johni got from Suej a promise PROj to leave.
(23)
Bill was promised to be allowed to leave.
(24)
a. Bill was promised to be permitted to leave.
b. *Bill was promised to permit Harry to leave.
c. *Bill was promised to get permission to leave.
d. *Bill was promised to leave the room.
e. *Bill was promised to be hit on the head. etc.
(2) the complement subject is the recipient of permission from the Source of the promise, and (3) the Source of the promise is an implicit argument. In the parallel nominal, the same conditions apply: (25)
(26)
The director gave the dancer a kick.
(27), the roles of director and dancer are reversed, just as in (21) (22).

a. Harry bought a yoyo in Chicago.
b. Harry bought a yoyo on Tuesday.
c. Harry bought a yoyo impulsively. etc.
(2)
a. Harry bought a yoyo from Marcia .
b. Sue drank the martini .
We have encoded such alternations in more or less traditional terms. The verb's subcategorization feature contains an optional position; if filled, it is coindexed to a conceptual argument; if unfilled, the conceptual argument becomes implicit.
(1) and (2), of course, hardly exhaust the full range of syntactic alternations. For another prominent case, consider the alternation of senses in the prepositions under and over in (3) (4).
(3)
a. The mouse is under the table.
b. The mouse ran around under the table.
c. The mouse ran under the table and stayed there.
d. The mouse ran under the table into a hole in the wall.
(4)
a. The plane is now over the city.
b. The plane flew around over the city.
c. The plane came over the city and started skywriting there.
d. The plane flew over the city towards the mountains.
a. [Event BE ([Thing MOUSE], [Place UNDER ([Thing TABLE])])] b.
(9)
The dashed line still has to include the right-hand parenthesis and bracket at the end, but at least it avoids the obnoxious crossing of bracketed material in (7) and the sense of disorientation I find in reading (8).
(10)
Here the braces are not so pretty either, but they will have to do, for reasons to become apparent in a moment.
(11)
a. Bill ran up the hill/down the road/through the tunnel.
b. Bill's house is up the hill/down the road/through the tunnel (from here).
(14)
We next turn to two applications of the dashed underline notation to verbs. There are many verbs of English, for instance those in (15), that alternate between a State reading and an Event reading.
(15)
a. The weathervane pointed north.
b. The enemy surrounded the city.
c. Bill stood on the table.
d. Snow covered the hills.
(18)
A second and possibly more controversial application of the dashed underline notation to verbs is the causative alternation.
Consider a typical case such as slide in (19a, b).
(19)
a. The box slid down the stairs.
b. Bill slid the box down the stairs.
In order for Argument Fusion to apply properly, the conceptual structures for the two senses must be (20a, b) respectively.
(22)
a. Joe climbed (for hours).
b. Joe climbed the mountain.
c.
As observed in section 2.2, the conceptual structure for the transitive case (abstracting away from various complications) is (23).
(23)
(27)
a. The train passed.
b. The train passed the station.
(29)
With a few possibly idiomatic exceptions such as pass from sight, the PP-complements of pass are restricted to Routesessentially Paths whose Path-function is VIA.
(30)
The Path-constituent here abbreviates the two possibilities shown in (31).

Unlike transitive and intransitive eat, these forms cannot be collapsed into a single entry by just making the NP argument optional: the intransitive form does not just make the Theme implicit but rather binds the Theme to the Agent.
(1)
a. Willy wiggled.
b. Debbie danced.
c. The top spun.
d. The flag waved.
Compare (1) to (2), where there is an implicit Path.

b. The railroad used to reach Kansas City, till they tore it up.
c. The railroad finally/soon reached Kansas City.
c. [Event INCH ([State EXT ([ . . . ], [ . . . ])])] For the present, we will regard the function INCH as a primitive; in Jackendoff (in preparation) it will be composed into a bundle of more general features.
(22)

b. John got the award by means of a clever trick.
(26)
The main clause of (24a) maps into the ''main conceptual clause" of (26); the subordinate clause of (24a) maps into the argument of BY. In turn, BY plus its argument is a restrictive modifier of the main conceptual clause.
(27)
a. John got the award because he did something clever.
b. John got the award because of his good looks.
c. John trned yellow from eating carrots.
d.

In order to construct these structures, there must be a general formation rule of conceptual structure that licenses the new modifier. The rule is roughly of the form (26).
(26), the general form of the licensing rule within the theory of Conceptual Semantics, is a definite improvement over old-time solutions that did such things as transformationally derive Bill hit Fred in the nose from Bill hit Fred's nose. From the evidence in the above discussion it should be easy to construct an argument why such a solution is impossible, so I will not spell it out.

NPi detach NPj from NPk.
(2) Ordinary instruments do not incorporate into verbs of detachment. One can hammer a picture to a wall, but one cannot *unhammer it, though one may unglue it. I leave the resolution for future research.

Next comes the usual question: are the inchoatives genuine inchoatives, that is, INCH BE-verbs, or are they GO-verbs?
(56)
a. Sam built the house out of bricks b. Sam assembled the bricks into a house.
c. Sam broke the bowl into pieces.
(57)
a. Sam built the house out of bricks.
b. Sam assembled the bricks into a house.

This analysis provides the proper range of distinctions. The verbs of composition and decomposition are differentiated, and the prepositions into and out of correspond to the Path-functions TO and FROM in the correct way.
(58)
a. The house is in pieces/ruins.
b. The book is in three parts.
(1)
a. Sue hit Fred.
b. The car hit the tree.
c. Pete hit the ball into the field.
In (1a), Sue is evidently the Agent. But what is Fred? I have seen it said that Fred is the Theme, because it is the thing affected.
(3)
a. What happened to Fred was Sue hit him.
b. What happened to the tree was the car hit it.
c. What happened to the ball was Pete hit it into the field.
(4)
a. *What Bill did to the room was enter it.
b. What Pete did to the ball was hit it into the field.

a. The sodium emitted electrons. (What the sodium did was emit electrons.)
b. Bill ran down the hill. (What Bill did was roll down the hill.)
c. The sponge absorbed the water. (What the sponge did was absorb the water.)
(7)
a. Sue hit Fred.
 Theme Goal (thematic tier)
b. Pete threw the ball  Source Theme (thematic tier)

a. *What Bill did was receive a letter.
b.? *What happened to Bill was he received a letter.
c. *What happened to the letter was Bill received it.
(9)
AFF (''affect") is an additional mainstream function alongside the thematic functions. The first argument of this function is the Actor; the second is the Patient. For example, The car hit the tree now receives the conceptual structure (10).
(10)
Up until this point, all conceptual functions have had a fixed number of arguments. If the Path argument of GO, for instance, is not filled syntactically, we still understand the Theme as traversing a Path, for example in Bill entered. However, as (9)
(11)
a. What Bill did was roll down the hill.
b. What happened to Bill was he rolled down the hill.
(12)
a.
b. 2 We need a convention for notating AFF when only one of its arguments is present; a notation like (13a) would be ambiguous.
(13)
a. [AFF ([X])] (X = Actor or Patient?)
b. [AFF ([X]), ] (X = Actor only)
c. [AFF ( , [Y])] (Y = Patient only)
d. [AFF ([ ], [Y])] (implicit Actor)

c. Harry failed to go away.
(23)

(25)
What Harry did for/?*to Sam was help him go away.
(27)
Verbs of helping: AFF+ (HARRY, SAM)
(28)
Verbs of letting: AFF0 (HARRY, SAM)
a.
b.
The combination of AFF0 and CS , something failing to happen as a result of being permitted, is again pragmatically bizarre (though perhaps imaginable with a parent as Actor and a perversely rebellious teenager as Beneficiary).
(29)
Thus double-object give has the conceptual structure (30).
(30)
a. What Harry did with/*to/*for the books was give every one of  them to Sam.
b. ?What Harry did with the books was give Sam every one of them.
(16).
Since give is the causative of receive, the latter must have the conceptual structure (32).
(32)
(33)
a. Sam gave in to Harry('s pressure on him).
b. Sam withstood Harry('s pressure on him).
c. Sam resisted Harry('s pressure on him).
(34)
Sam resisted Harry.

a. The valve let the water out. (entraining)
b. Bill released the brid from the cage. (launching)
(40)
a. This fence constrains the cattle.
b. This hole lets the water out.
c. This highway leads (you) to Tucson.
d. The windowshade blocks the light.
(41)
This hole lets the water out.
(41) contrasts minimally with the ongoing Event This hole is letting the water out, which in the present analysis differs only in the substitution of Event for State.
(42)
a. X entails/implies/leads to Y. (cause)
b. X rules out/precludes Y. (cause . . . not)
c. X permits/is consistent with Y. (let)
d. X reinforces/supports Y. (help)
(43)
a. Thunder frightens Bill. (stative)
b. Harry (deliberately) frightened Bill.
b. X displeases Y. [State AFF ([X], [Y])] c. X (suddenly) frightened Y.
d. X strikes Y as crazy. [State AFFu ([X], [Y])] e. X matters to Y. [State AFFu ([X], [Y])] (45)
(46)
a. Phil opened the door with a key.
b. Sam broke the window with a hammer.
(47)
a.
b.
(1)
a. Sue hit Fred.
b. The car hit the tree.
c. Pete hit the ball into the field.
(48)
The car hit the tree.
That is, by virtue of the car's coming to be in contact with the tree, it comes to act on the tree.
(49)
However, we cannot just add this as a modifier of a structure like (48), since what comes into contact with Fred is not Sue but the stick. Thus the conceptual structure has to be (50).
(50)
Sue hit Fred with a Stick.
(50). Again, this extension of meaning is lexically specific to hit. Kick, for example, selects the foot as default Instrument and cannot substitute an Instrument that is very different: Bill kicked Harry with his left foot/*a stick.
(51)
Pete hit the ball into the field with a stick .
(50) without changing the sense appreciably, but it cannot be substituted into (51): (52)
a. The car struck the tree.
b. Sue struck Fred with a stick.
c. *Pete struck the ball into the field (with a stick).

That is, the Actor is also Instigator, and the Patient or Beneficiary is Actor of the (potential) Effect. (54) illustrates.

Here the Actor is again Instigator, but this time there is no Patient, and the Actor is also Actor of the (potential) Effect. (56)
illustrates.
(56)
Sami tried go away.
(57)
In this case, the Instigator is bound to the second argument of REACT, and the Actor of the potential Effect is bound to the first argument of REACT. That is, the Instigator b is exerting effort toward a's doing something, and a is reacting against b. (58)
(58)
Sami resisted going away.
Here the Instigator is entirely implicit, but its multiple roles are still indicated by the argument binding.
(60)
The curly bracket notation in (60) abbreviates two lexical conceptual structures, one already seen in (59) and the other shown in (61).
(65)
In (65a), the direct object is the antagonist, the second argument of REACT. In (65b), the gerundive is the potential Effect, and its subject is obligatorily controlled by the subject of resist. (65c) and (65d) are syntactically parallel but semantically different.
(66)
This is an elaboration of the REACT pattern (57). There are three alternatives in the curly brackets this time, broken out separately in (67).

b. *Bill covered a tarpaulin (on) the ground.
c. Bill covered the ground (with a tarpaulin). (causative inchoative).
d. *The ground covered (with snow).
(4)
One thing that distinguishes fill and cover from other verbs of inchoative location is that they incorporate a ''distributive location" in the sense of section 6.1. Let us notate distributive location with the subscript d, and ordinary location without it.
(6)
Similar tactics of Lexical Abbreviation will be necessary for the with-phrases in both variants of fill.
(7)
The rule we want can be stated informally as (8). (A similar rule is proposed by Rappaport and Levin (1988) and by Rappaport, Levin, and Laughren (1988).) (9) is a more formal statement.

With-Theme Adjunct Rule (version 1)
(9)
With-Theme Adjunct Rule (version 2)
(12)
Under the present account, the with-phrase does not have to be mentioned in the subcategorization; syntactically the verb is a pure intransitive. Argument Fusion inserts the reading of the subject into the reference object argument. In addition, though, (2d)
(14)
In this entry, the subject is mapped into the Agent position and the object is mapped into the Goal; the Theme is unindexed and therefore completely incorporated into the reading of the verb.
(15)
We buttered the bread with cheap margarine/with soft, creamy unsalted butter.
(15) meets the structural description of the With-Theme Adjunct Rule (9), so that the with-phrase is fused with the incorporated theme BUTTER. That is, the with-phrase comes to function as Theme even though it is not licensed as such by the LCS of the verb.
(16)
a. The windshield iced up (with tiny crystals).
b. The bathroom steamed up (with clouds of steam).
(18)
a. #We buttered the bread with pineapple juice.
b. We buttered the bread with that stuff you bought yesterday.
This is exactly what would be expected from the fusion of BUTTER with the object of with.
(19)
a. ?We buttered the bread with butter.
b. ?We buttered the bread with something.
(20)
a. He drank some liquid.
b. He drank something.
c. ?He paid Bill some money for the book.
(21)
With-Theme Adjunct Rule (version 3)
The sentences in (19) fail this last condition; otherwise everything proceeds as before.
(22)
c. *Bill uncovered the field (*with a tarpaulin). (cf. cover)
d. *Bill skinned the banana (*with its smooth yellow skin)
(23)
a. The tank emptied of water.
b. Bill emptied the tank of water.
c. *Bill uncovered the field of a/the tarpaulin.
d. *Bill skinned the banana of its smooth yellow skin.
(24)
a. The With-Theme Adjunct Rule is formally constrained to apply only to ''positive" verbs.
b. The verbs in (22) are all "negative" in some sense and so do not satisfy the conditions of the With-Theme Adjunct Rule.
c. The "negativity" of uncover and skin is encoded in a formally different fashion from that of empty.
d. The of-phrase in (23a, b) is interpreted by a different adjunct rule, whose structural description applies only to the form of "negativity" present in empty.
(27)
Another class of denominal verbs is illustrated in (28).
(28)
a. The chimney smoked (*with/*of a strong sulfurous smoke).
b. The soup steamed (*with/*of clouds of steam).
(32)
With-Theme Adjunct Rule (version 4)
(33)
a. The table is/seems/stayed [AP covered with flowers].
b. The room is/seems/stayed [AP all steamed up with clouds of freon vapor].
c. The sink is/seems/stayed [AP empty of water].
(34)
a. Fred bottled the wine.
b. Herb deftly pocketed the money.
c. We finally packaged the potato chips.
The structure of the verb bottle is thus (35a) (if it is a GO-verb) or (35b) (if it is an INCH BE-verb).
(35)
However, the verbs in (34) also allow PP-complements that fill in more details about the Theme's final location: (36)
a. Fred bottled the wine in tall green bottles/*in bottles.
b. Herb deftly pocketed the money in his left pocket/*in his pocket.
c. We finally packaged the potato chips in air-cushioned packets/*in packages.
(38)
a.
b.
(39).
(39)
(40)
Thus the PP-Adjunct Rule permits interpretation of a wide variety of Place- and Path-PPs that previously could not be integrated into the readings of sentences, and moreover permits the simplification of a large number of lexical entries of verbs that take PPcomplements.
(41)
a. Bill loaded hay onto the truck.
b. Bill sprayed paint onto the wall.
c. Bill packed books into the boxes.
d. Bill stuffed groceries into the bag.
(42)
a. Bill loaded the truck (with hay).
b. Bill sprayed the wall (with paint).
c. Bill packed the boxes (with books).
d. Bill stuffed the bag (with groceries).

b. Bill drained the sink (of (the/*some)

Note also that drain, like empty, has a noncausative inchoative variant (The sink drained (of water)); clear lacks this variant.

(50) in which the of-phrase is subcategorizedthe sort of entry we rejected for cover back in section 8.2. ((50) omits the interesting selectional restriction on the Theme argument that it be considered somehow objectionable to the Agent or to the speaker.)
(50)
Thus this particular of-phrase is not interpreted by the Of-Theme Adjunct Rule, even though it has exactly the same interpretation as the of-adjunct of emptyan apparent loss of generality.

e. ?What the Lorelei did to her victims was sing to them.
(58)
a. Harry rolled himself along the carpet.
(resultative)
b. *What Harry did to himself was roll (himself).
Thus it appears that spatial resultatives in most respects generalize with Identificational resultatives, although the differences in judgments in (56) remain to be explained. Leaving these aside, the rule can be stated as (59).
(61)
a. Bill painted the house a disgusting shade of red.
b. MIT made me a linguist.
(62)
a. New seedlings water flat easily.

 *What I did to the room was enter it.
b. *The letters receive easily.
 *What I did to the letters was receive them.
c. *The books buy easily.
 *What I did to the books was buy them.
(On the other hand, there are exceptions, for example This book reads easily but ?*What I did to the book was read it.)
(66)
a. The slicing of cheese into thin wedges is the current rage.
b. The painting of fire engines the color of schoolbuses is strictly prohibited by state law.
c. The surgeon general warns against the cooking of food black.

The gardener watered the tulips flat.
(68)
a. What the gardener did to the tulips was he watered them flat.
b. What the gardener did to the tulips was he made them flat by watering them. (Means paraphrase)
c. ??What the gardener did to the tulips was his watering them made them flat. (Agent paraphrase)
d. What the gardener's watering the tulips did to them was it made them flat. (Agent paraphrase)
(69)
a. Harold belched his way out of the restaurant.
b. Bill jumped into Harriet's arms.
(70)
a. Harold's belching made him go out of the restaurant.
b. Bill's jumping made him go/got him into Harriet's arms. (wrong meaning)
In other words, the structure induced by rule (48) forms a natural class with other constructions, whereas structure (67) does not.
(71)
a. It snowed the roads slippery.
b. It rained the seedlings flat.
c. It thundered the children awake.
d. It rained the golf course useless.
e. It rained the animals nearly crazy.
(72)
a. The toast burned black/to a cinder.
b. The lake froze solid/into a solid mass.
c. The pitcher broke into a million little fragments.
d. The candybar melted into a gooey mess.
e. The corn grew as high as an elephant's eye.
f. The pebbles rolled smooth.
(48) in much the same way as noncausative break and roll are related to their causative variants. In fact, (75) shows that this construction shares the property of intransitive break and roll (noted in section 7.1) of having an ambiguous action tier.
(75)
a. What the toast did was burn black.
b. What the lake did was freeze solid.
What happened to the lake was it froze solid.
(73).
(59) (Harry sneezed himself across the room)
(76)
a. *The rocket burned into the hotel. (in sense ''The rocket got into the hotel by burning")
b. *The water froze out of the bottle. (in sense "The water got out of the bottle by freezing")
c. *The window broke into the room.
(77)
a. The chocolate melted out of the box.
b. The corn grew over the top of the house. (possible PPadjunct)
c. The pebbles rolled out of the box. (GO-adjunct)
I do not want to pursue the relevant restrictions here. The main point is that the spatial causative resultatives do not generalize to the noncausative case in exactly the same way as the Identificational resultatives do.

(1957) noted a close relationship, though he explicitly denied that it is one-to-one. The theory of the relationship between syntactic and semantic arguments is now generally called linking theory; this chapter will lay out the preliminaries of a linking theory whose semantic roles are those of Conceptual Semantics.

As a result, the task faced by Argument Linking per se is considerably simplified.

Hierarchical Argument Linking (version 2)
(11)
Unlike our previous entries, (11) has neither a subcategorization feature nor the indices in LCS that specify argument structure.
(13)
a. Water (slowly) filled the tank.
b. The tank (slowly) filled (with water).
Recall that (13a) and (13b) were analyzed in section 8.2 as having the same conceptual structure, (14).
(15)
a. [INCH [BE ([ ]i, [INd [ ]j])]] (for (13a))
b. [INCH [BE ([ ], [INd [ ]i])]] (for (13b))
(16)
a. Snow (slowly) covered the field.
b. *The field (slowly) covered (with snow).
(17)
Recall that this entry encodes the alternate conceptual structures given in (18).
(18)
a. [Path VIA [Place NEAR [Thing ]j]] (argument is Thing, as in The train passed the station)
b. [Path VIA [Place ]]j (argument is Path, as in The train passed through the tunnel)

The dwarves decorated/*encrusted the throne.
c. Bill supplied/provided the students with some books.
d. Bill robbed/deprived Harry of his money.
Bill robbed/*deprived Harry.
These involve contrasts of obligatory versus optional expression of conceptual arguments, just like eat/devour or put/insert.
(23)
The Theme is unindexed, hence susceptible to the Of-Theme Adjunct Rule, which provides an interpretation for the of-phrase.
(27)
a. Harry became/went/got crazy.
b. Harry became/*went/*got a raving maniac.
c. Harry ??became/went/*got out of his mind.

(32) (34) as a challenge to its proponents.
A notable gap in this list is ditransitive causative verbs of motion. A pattern like (35) does not exist, though the hierarchy does not rule it out.
(35)
*Actor/Agent, Patient/Theme, Goal: *Harry entered the car the tunnel.
(35) is awful enough to seem a principled gap. The best solution I can offer within the minimal syntactic theory is to restrict the choices for top-to-bottom matching to a stipulated class of possible linkages. This class is given in (36), which differentiates spatial from identificational reference objects; only the latter are permitted to link to 2nd object.
(36)
(36) lists possible linkings; top-to-bottom matching is carried out just among these possibilities.
a. Into each indexed constituent in H's LCS, fuse the conceptual structure of that phrase YP that satisfies the coindexed position in H's subcategorization feature.
b. If H is a verb, fuse the conceptual structure of the subject into the constituent indexed i in H's LCS.
(39)
Argument Linking (version 3)
a. Order the A-marked constituents in the verb's LCS according to the thematic hierarchy (30).
b. Order the NP-constituents in the syntactic structure according to the syntactic hierarchy (31).
(36).
Given this rule, syntactic structure (37) is matched with (38a) in the manner shown in (40a); it is matched with (38b) as in (40b).

b. Order the NP-constituents in the syntactic structure according to the syntactic hierarchy (31).
c. Optionally coindex APs, PPs, and S¢s freely to A-marked constituents in the LCS.

Linking hierarchy The External Argument can then be treated in a variety of ways, say those in (52).
a. If the head is a V, and there is a subject, coindex the External Argument with the subject.
b. If the head is a V, and there is no subject, satisfy the External Argument with a bound variable x. (see rule (9.72))
c. If the head is an N, suppress the A-marking on the External Argument.
d. In a subjectless main clause with a tenseless V, satisfy the External Argument with [YOU].
(53)
Argument Linking (version 5)
a. Order the A-marked constituents in the verb's LCS according to the thematic hierarchy (30).
b. Order the NP-constituents in V¢ according to the syntactic hierarchy (31).
c. Link the first A-marked constituent with the External Argument.
d. Optionally coindex APs, PPs, and S¢s freely to A-marked constituents in the LCS.
e. Coindex the NPs in V¢ with the remaining A-marked constituents in thematic order, choosing coindexations from among the possibilities in the network (51).

With-Theme Adjunct (version 5)
(56)
Adjunct Fusion (version 1)
b. [INCH [BE ([Thing ]A, [INd [Thing ]A])]] Adjunct Fusion combines (57a) with (55) to form (58).
(55). One can think of various ways to incorporate it: stipulation again, conventions on Adjunct Fusion, conventions on explicit linking. Having no evidence bearing on this issue, I leave it open.
(59)
Recipient NP Adjunct Let us use (59) to derive the conceptual structure of Bill threw Harry the ball. The LCS of throw is (60).
(60)
Note that throw has two A-marked arguments, the Actor/Agent and the Patient/Theme. Combining (60) with (59) by Adjunct Fusion yields (61).
(61) then undergoes Argument Linking. The Actor position links as usual to subject position. The next argument on the thematic hierarchy is Patient, which normally would link to first object position. However, in (61) the first object is prelinked, so the Patient goes one step down the syntactic hierarchy to second object. The result is (62).
(62)
This straightforwardly undergoes Argument Fusion, substituting the readings of Bill, Harry, and the ball into the i, k, and j arguments respectively.
(63)

b.
(65)
Adjunct Fusion (version 2)
(66)
The Path-constituent is then linked with the PP by the PP-Adjunct Rule; Argument Linking and the External Argument Rule coindex the Actor with the subject; and Argument Fusion fills in the readings of the single linked argument.

Argument Linking applies to (70a) to give the partial correspondence shown in (71).
(72)
a.
b.
Argument Fusion then applies in the usual way to fill in the readings of Bill, Harry, and drunk. The resulting two readings are precisely as desired.
b. Every conceptual constituent that is required to link is in fact linked.
This is the present theory's counterpart of the q-Criterion.
(76)
a. Apply Adjunct Fusion to combine LCS of head with elements containing Vh-type linking.
b. Convert A-linking into constant linking: Apply Argument Linking and External Argument Linking to output of (a)
(using thematic and syntactic hierarchy for NP arguments).
c. Apply rules containing variable linking, depending on constant linkings established in (a), (b).
d. Integrate readings of linked arguments into overall reading: Apply Argument Fusion, following constant linkings established in (a), (b), (c).
e. Integrate readings of modifiers: Apply Restrictive Modifier Rule.

a. Bill wanted to leave.
b. Bill wanted [for Bill to leave]  One of the difficulties with this was that (iia) and (iib) had to be derived from the same underlying structure, (iic).
a. A funny old man wanted to leave.
b. A funny old man wanted a funny old man to leave.
c. A funny old man wanted [for a funny old man to leave]  The solution adopted, which persists in current theory, was to eliminate Equi-NP Deletion and to claim that (ia) and (iia)
have the structures in (iii), while (iib) retains (iic) as its structure.
a. Bill wanted [PROi leave] b. A funny old mani wanted [PROi leave]  Much of current binding theory grew out of exploring this solution.

j_71		Bill bought a (red) house, and Max bought one too.
j_71		can be derived by applying R-Deletion in the second clause, deleting, as we would expect, (red) house. Then, since one is not functioning as a proclitic, it does not reduce to a as it does in the first clause. Thus, what have been taken to be the paradigm cases of one-pronominalization can be handled by other rules. This leaves only the cases where an adjective precedes one, such as a blue one, Max's revolting one. To get these, we could simply restrict one-pronominalization to environments with an adjective present; or we could leave one-pronominalization more general and add a one-deletion trans
j_71		formation like Perlmutter's to eliminate the cases without adjectives. I do not have any evidence to decide between these approaches, although the former sounds somewhat simpler. Perhaps some more interesting solution will be found.

p_70		Harriet struck me as being clever we find an initial subject NP, a post-verbal NP, and a clausal fragment without its subject which is understood as a coreferent of the subject of strike. The selectional facts, then, are these:
p_70		the subject in such cases is unrestricted with respect to strike itself, but is restricted with respect to the clausal fragment
p_70		the post-verbal NP in such cases must be animate, possibly "human" in some sense (exclusive of babies, for example)

p_70		The regularity in b holds predictably for the verb strike.
p_70		Given a superficial analysis of remind as a deep verb occurring with no complement and three NP within its immediate clause, fact a and fact b are unrelated, merely accidental cofeatures of English.
p_70		Given the strike-like analysis, (I 35b), by way of its special case, (I 35d), automatically has (I35a) as a consequence.

p_70		(I57), which do not? The answer, if one recalls the analysis of verbs presented in part B(5), is that the verbs in (I56) undergo PSYCH MOVEMENT, while those in

p_70		on Mars, one builds one's house near a canal to refer to Martians, then we can say:

p_70		a regular rule (I 76c (i))

p_70		a special rule limited in scope to remind which says just what (I 76c (i)) says for the regular cases
p_70		shows that the alternative to the strike-like analysis is an account in which the perfectly regular properties of remind must be taken to involve two separate irregularities, an exception statement for (I 76c (i)) and a special rule to do the work of (I 76c (i)) in the single case. It is hard to conceive of a stronger argument for an analysis of the type under discussion.

One is the parallelism with sentences like (25ob), which shows that want takes infinitival complements with full sentence form. Hence, to block com
p_70		Harry wants to justify himself
p_70		Harry wants to visit his own father since these forms are in general subject to the constraint that a coreferent in the same clause must precede them. Other arguments include the fact that the deletion analysis from Remote Structures like (251) explains such gaps as:

p_70	*	Harry is asking Joan whether Max strikes him as crazy the Experiencer NP must apparently be a coreferent of the "indirect object" of the next highest verb of saying/ thinking. Consequently, in superficially unembedded interrogatives, the Experiencer NP must be second person:

p_70		the wall looked green to me (it looked to me as if the wall were green)
p_70		I saw that the wall was green one could be wrong only in the latter case. That is, if it is pointed out that the wall was blue and only seemed green due to artificial light, one would agree that (ii) expressed a false statement. But (i) would still express a truth. And indeed, if used honestly, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which (i) could fail to express a truth. This difference also seems valid for such pairs as seem, think, although possibly not so clear for them.

p_70		it struck Harry that you were a vampire which are in the past tense. However, the natural interpretation of the conditions under which these are used is that the individual designated by Harry has informed others of his subjective experience in the time interval whose existence is guaranteed by the past tense. In short, sentences like (277) seem equivalent to those of the form:
